To this end, the further development and spread of (multi)resistance must be managed as much as possible, in order to ensure that effective treatment of infections with antibiotics remains possible in future.\n",

From a public health perspective, a ban on the use of last resort antibiotics (such as carbapenems) for the treatment of animals will be addressed, with reference to the current legislative process of relevant EU regulations.\n",

Resistance levels of bacteria in livestock have also dropped in recent years. Our current goal focuses on a 70% reduction compared with 2009. The sectors and veterinarians will need to do everything in their power to further reduce antibiotic use. In order to achieve a further reduction, effort is needed specifically on: Additional measures by sectors/veterinarians and strong continuation of implementation of the current policy. The large animal farming sectors face the challenge of stimulating farmers and veterinarians in the 'action area' (red) and the 'warning area' (orange) to shift towards the 'target area' (green) of restrained and prudent antibiotic use.\n",
