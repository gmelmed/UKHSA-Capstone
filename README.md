#### **>> Activity in progress: Playing with prompts.**

Note: The Markdown files are already available in the folder **"data/03-naps-md"** (containing only countries for testing). So, we can directly use the notebook **"3. nap_prompting_test_gd_0602_2300.ipynb"** as a sample to play with prompts. There are examples for Norway and Chile, using either the whole document or chunks with embedding.
