In Germany, data on AMR in human medicine is collated in the antibiotic resistance surveillance system (ARS) established at the RKI... To further improve available data, efforts should be made to harmonise the surveillance systems. Also, to be able to arrive at more detailed conclusions on the prevalence and spread of AMR, the national surveillance systems for both the outpatient and inpatient settings should be further developed and enhanced.",

Existing surveillance structures are often only of a temporary nature, financed using project funds and limited to larger conurbations in many cases. They thus provide an inadequate picture of the resistance situation and the AMR load. New surveillance systems must be able to collect both nationwide and cross-sectoral data. In line with the One Health approach, resistance data from human medicine, veterinary medicine, the environmental sector and food production must be integrated.",
