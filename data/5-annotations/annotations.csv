netherlands;1;yes;;"Actors agree to the following goals: The number of avoidable healthcare-associated infections 10 will be reduced by 50% in five years, compared with a baseline defined by the relevant actors. During the next five years, the objective is to achieve a reduction of at least 50% in the use of incorrectly prescribed antibiotics across the entire
healthcare chain"
netherlands;2;yes;;"The reduction of antibiotic use has flattened. Our current goal focuses on a 70%
reduction compared with 2009. The sectors and veterinarians will need to do
everything in their power to further reduce antibiotic use. In order to achieve a
further reduction, effort is needed specifically on: Additional measures by sectors/veterinarians and strong continuation of implementation of the current policy. The large animal farming sectors face the challenge of stimulating farmers and veterinarians in the 'action area' (red) and the 'warning area' (orange) to shift towards the 'target area' (green) of restrained and prudent antibiotic use. The sectors and veterinarians have already prepared additional measures that will be executed in 2015.
· Prudent and restricted use in other animal sectors (pets, horses, rabbits, etc.)
along with reduction of critical antibiotic use in these sectors to this end. We
will develop an approach in 2015.
· Continuation of more stringent NVWA (the Netherlands Food and Consumer
Product Safety Authority) inspections and enforcement of restricted antibiotic
use in animal farming and identification and control of illegal activities.
· Improvement of general animal health in order to achieve extremely restricted
antibiotic use. This is a crucial challenge for actors in the chain, sectors and
individual animal farmers, in consultation with their veterinarians. It is
important that restricted and prudent antibiotic use is linked to the innovation
and sustainability agendas of all the chains affected."
netherlands;3;yes;;"Despite these uncertainties, the research by ZonMw and the recommendations by
the RIVM show that the environment does play a role in the transmission of
antibiotic resistance. This outcome provides ample reason to initiate a number of
activities.
1. We will ask the RIVM to draft an action plan for gaining better insight into the
situation in the Netherlands. Where necessary, the RIVM will involve other
actors (e.g. veterinary institutions/experts). This action plan must result in an
advisory report on the most effective management measures by mid 2016. At
the very least, the implementation of the action plan must encompass
measurement of the occurrence of resistant bacteria and the presence of
(traces of) antibiotics in the environment. To this end, measurements will be
performed in waste water from health facilities and residential areas, in waste
water treatment plants and in manure, among other places. The research will
begin soon. Besides, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has commissioned
research into the presence of antibiotic residues in manure. The studies will be
harmonised.
2. Additionally, antibiotic resistance will be included in a number ofinitiatives,
such as the Green Deal sustainable operations in healthcare15 and in the new
water quality policy."
netherlands;4;no;;
netherlands;5;yes;;"We will regularly inform Parliament of the progress of the approach to antibiotic
resistance. We propose to send an initial progress report in late December 2015."
netherlands;6;yes;;The number of avoidable healthcare-associated infections 10 will be reduced by 50% in five years, compared with a baseline defined by the relevant actors. 
netherlands;7;no;;
netherlands;8;no;;
netherlands;9;yes;;"For professionals, the strategy consists of sharing knowledge and stimulating
new developments. Additionally, there will be more focus on reminding
professionals of the sense of urgency, placing it higher on the agenda.
Suggested courses of action will also be offered within the professional field,
for example in the domain of hygiene."
netherlands;10;yes;;"This strategy includes:
· Increasing public awareness of the problem and increasing knowledge about
how antibiotics work and should be used. A national campaign must raise
public awareness and give people more knowledge on which to base their own
choices. The campaign will provide simple, concrete tips for prevention. The
communication efforts will use existing instruments and channels wherever
possible, and new tools will be developed as needed. Additionally,
communication will be carried out by parties close to the public, such as GPs
and pharmacists, supported by the necessary campaign materials."
netherlands;11;yes;;"Additionally, the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM)
was recently appointed as WHO Collaborating Centre for Antimicrobial Resistance
Epidemiology and Surveillance. This means the RIVM provides technical support to
WHO member states in creating and strengthening surveillance of resistant
bacteria, following the Dutch model. Attention is also given to antibiotic resistance
in developing nations via Dutch support for the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis
and Malaria, with a particular focus on multiresistant tuberculosis."

netherlands;13;no;;
netherlands;14;yes;;"Providing concrete advice on the prevention of bacterial infections. Themes
include food safety, hygiene, transmission of (resistant) bacteria via pets and
the importance of following instructions about the use of antibiotics and
hygiene guidelines.                                                                                                                                                                 Early detection of and swift response to resistant bacteria and other infectious
threats ensure that the number of carriers9 of resistant bacteria and the
number of infections and deaths due to antibiotic resistance in the Netherlands
will remain at the current level or decrease"
netherlands;15;no;;
netherlands;16;yes;;"During the next five years, the objective is to achieve a reduction of at least
50% in the use of incorrectly prescribed antibiotics across the entire
healthcare chain, relative to a baseline determined with stakeholders.
Differences between healthcare domains and practice variation within one
domain will be taken into account. Further agreements between the
stakeholders will be founded on the baseline assessment. It is important to
consider agreements about prescription behaviour within the context of quality
of care; both over-treatment with antibiotics and under-treatment will be
taken into consideration."
netherlands;17;no;;
netherlands;18;no;;
netherlands;19;yes;;"We support the development of international fundamental scientific knowledge
by commissioning a new assignment to The Netherlands Organisation for
Health Research and Development (ZonMW) and by supporting permanent
participation in the European Joint Programming Initiative on antimicrobial
resistance. This programme strives for better cooperation between EU
member states (but also partner nations such as Canada) in the field of
research in order to harmonise national research programmes and jointly
initiate and fund expensive and complex research.                                                                                        We support and cooperate in international initiatives designed to develop new
business models. An existing example is the project 'DRIVE-AB’, which is
funded via the European Innovative Medicines Initiative and is also part of the
WHO Global Action Plan on antimicrobial resistance. Together with other
countries, the WHO and NGOs, we examine whether developments and good
use of new medicines can be stimulated via a public-private initiative, as is
currently the case for poverty-related diseases. "
