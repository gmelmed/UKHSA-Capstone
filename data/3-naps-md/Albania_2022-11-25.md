## NATIONAL ACTION PLAN AGAINST ANTI MICROBIAL RESISTANCE NAP-AMR

## Background

Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR) is the development of resistance by micro-organisms (bacteria, viruses and fungus) to medicines like antibiotics (AB) and virus inhibitors. Worldwide, the emergence of AMR threatens the capacity of health and veterinary services to adequately prevent and treat infections, with as a result increase of morbidity and loss of human life, loss of production and economic value in agriculture and increase of costs of health services.

The common interests and responsibilities of various sectors in society are captured under the name 'One Health': the health, agricultural, education and environm ental sectors all have a stake and collaborate in the NAP-AMR .

## Rational

Albania is signatory to the resolution of the WHO General Assembly of October 5, 2016 on AntiMicrobial Resistance, that commits member states to the development of multi-sectoral National Action Plans against AMR.

## The NAP-AMR

- -realizes compliance with the relevant EU policies and accession criteria, including directives on AMR monitoring in zoonotic and indicator bacteria in food producing animals.
- -works out explicit recommendations for AMR set in the Joint External evaluation of IHR core capacities of the Republic of Albania (September 2016)
- -addresses several of the strategic objectives of the health chapter of the National Strategy for Development and Integration 2015-2020: 2.1, 2.6, 3.2, 3.6, 4.4, 4.5, 5.1, 5.6,
- -is mentioned in the National Health Strategy 2016-2020 as one of the actions to fulfil the Strategy.
- -Is congruent with the Law on Public Health of 2009 and the Law of Infectious Diseases of 2017.
- -builds on Law No 15/2016: "On prevention and fight against infections and infectious diseases".
- -builds on the Ministerial Order 551 of the Minister of Health of December 15, 2016, addressing a National Policy on AMR.
- -is in synergy with National TB program

## Time line

The NAP-AMR covers a period of 5 years, 2018 -2022.

This draft describes activities and costs in the first year, 2018. Costs for the 5 years plan at present are approximate. The complete draft for the 5 year period is being written; it will include a more definite estimation of costs and a Monitoring &amp; Evaluation Plan.

## Goals

- 路 To reduce human morbidity and mortality as a result of infections with micro-organisms that are resistant against antibiotics and other anti-microbial agents.
- 路 To reduce health care costs that result from the lack of proper diagnostics, including microbiological tests, and from the use of ineffective treatments
- 路 To reduce loss of productivity in agriculture.
- 路 To preserve the possibility of effective treatment of infections in humans and animals by reducing the emergence and spread of AMR and by developing new and effective antimicrobials.

Currently, no representative data on the situation in Albania are available, in terms of morbidity and mortality of the population, presence of resistant strains of various micro-organisms and loss of production. Therefore, no quantitative targets for impact of the NAP-AMR can be set at present. The NAP-AMR includes the development of data collection and analysis to provide impact information in future.

## Activities and costs.

The NAP-AMR describes objectives, strategic interventions and activities and the entities that are responsible or contribute. Some activities are ongoing and will not require additional resources, other activities are new and require one-off investments and/or ongoing funding.

## Contents

Part 1, the General Objective, describes the overall governance infrastructure required to appropriately address AMR. Since the development of legislation and regulation is an ongoing task of the government, it is assumed that no additional costs for this part are needed.

Part 2 describes, in 4 Strategic Objectives, the general approach to (1) raising awareness of the population and professionals with regards to AMR; (2) monitoring the spread of AMR; (3) the prevention and control of infections and (4) rationalizing the use of ABs.

Part 3 describes the activities that pertain to the Strategic Objectives, including an estimation of costs. The complete NAP uses a phased approach: activities of the NAP will be developed gradually and not all will start in year 1.
