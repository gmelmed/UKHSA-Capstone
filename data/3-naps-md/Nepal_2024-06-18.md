## 2. Situation Analysis Executive Summary

Antimicrobial  resistance  (AMR)  is  one  of  the  major  public  health  issues  globally. World Health Organization has listed it as one of the top ten global public health threats  facing  humanity.  Addressing  this  issue  promptly  is  crucial  to  preserving the achievements made in the health and medicine sector thus far. Antimicrobial resistance is attributed to approximately 1.3 million deaths worldwide annually, with a projected global economic loss of 1 to 3 trillion US Dollars by 2030. It is estimated that by 2030, AMR could force up to 28 million people into extreme poverty.

In May 2015, the 68th World Health Assembly endorsed the Global Action Plan (GAP) on Antimicrobial Resistance (GAP-AMR) to tackle AMR and urged the member states to develop their own National Action Plan on AMR in alignment with GAP-AMR by May 2017. Nepal also expressed its commitment to develop a National Action Plan to combat AMR at the United Nations General Assembly on 21 September 2016.

Various  policy  documents,  including  the  National  Health  Policy,  2076  (2019),  the Fifteenth Five-Year Plan, and the National Animal Health Policy, 2078, issued by the Government of Nepal have prioritized AMR as an important public health issue and have highlighted the need to address without delay.

To  contain  AMR,  this  multisectoral  NAP  has  been  developed  in  coordination  and collaboration with the relevant sectors and stakeholders. The five strategic priorities identified for the NAP-AMR are as follows:

- 1. Improve awareness and understanding of AMR through effective communication, education, and training,
- 2. Strengthen the knowledge and evidence related to AMR through surveillance and research,
- 3. Reduce the incidence of infection through effective infection prevention and control,

- 4. Optimize the use of antimicrobial agents in the human, animal, and food sectors,
- 5. Ensure sustainable resources for the containment of AMR along with promoting investment in research and innovation.

Each strategic priority has its own set of objectives, and various strategic interventions under these objectives and various activities based on such strategic interventions have  been  proposed.  Within  each  strategic  priority  and  focus  area,  strategic interventions including the key activities and key outputs for those interventions have  been  provided  along  with  timelines  for  completion  -  short  (within  1  year), medium (between 1 and 3 years), and long-term (between 3 and 5 years).

Various  committees  have  been  proposed  for  the  implementation  of  this  action plan. Provisions have been made for coordination and collaboration with all three tiers of government. It is expected that resources will be managed with the support of  all  three  tiers  of  government,  development  partners  and  nongovernmental organizations.

The NAP-AMR also includes the monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) plan to assess the quality of the activities being implemented and track the progress.

The primary objective of the NAP-AMR is to ensure the rational use of antimicrobials and contain AMR.  This plan is expected to improve awareness and understanding regarding  AMR  in  Nepal,  reduce  inappropriate  antimicrobial  consumption  and optimize antimicrobial use. It is expected that the NAP-AMR will improve IPC in Nepal and eventually contribute substantially to AMR containment in the country.

The  development  of  a  comprehensive  and  integrated  approach  at  the  national, provincial, and local levels has been ensured to address AMR. At the same time, all sectors  of 'One  Health'  and  stakeholders  including  all  professional  organizations, academia,  civil  societies,  media,  and  consumer  groups  will  be  engaged  in  the successful implementation of this National Action Plan.

This NAP is expected to bring greater coordination and cooperation among 'One Health' stakeholders to contain AMR, which will aid in the management of patients, reduce morbidity and mortality, and achieve SDGs and Universal Health Coverage.

## 1. Background

Antimicrobial  resistance  has  emerged  as  a  major  public  health  issue  worldwide. With the emergence of resistance in bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses that cause human  illnesses,  medical  treatment  of  infections  faces  a  heightened  challenge. Antimicrobial resistance is attributed to approximately 1.3 million deaths worldwide annually, with a global economic loss of 1 to 3 trillion US Dollars by 2030, according to a World Bank projection. It is estimated that by 2030, AMR could force up to 28 million people into extreme poverty. In addition, in low-income countries, the cost of medical treatment resulting from AMR is projected to increase by 25 percent, which, in turn, jeopardizes the achievements of the SDGs 2030.

Recognizing the threat early on, health ministers from the South-East Asia Region, including Nepal, signed the Jaipur Declaration on Antimicrobial Resistance in 2011 (WHO SEARO, 2011).

In  May  2015,  the  68th  World  Health  Assembly  endorsed  the  Global  Action  Plan (GAP) on Antimicrobial Resistance (GAP-AMR) based on a 'One Health' approach to tackle AMR. The GAP emphasizes the importance of multi-sectoral involvement in addressing the problem of AMR.

In 2016, the global commitment to combat AMR was further strengthened by the high-level meeting on AMR at the United Nations General Assembly, in which global leaders reiterated their commitment to act on AMR through a political declaration that was adopted as a UN General Assembly resolution (UN, 2016). At the global level, the United Nations Secretary-General has established the Interagency Coordination Group  (IACG)  to  improve  coordination  among  international  organizations  and  to ensure effective global action against this threat to health security. The IACG is cochaired by the UN Deputy Secretary-General and the Director-General of WHO and includes  high-level  representatives  of  relevant  UN  agencies,  other  international organizations, and individual experts across different sectors.

In Nepal, the Public Health Service Act, 2075 (2018) prohibits the sale or distribution of  antibiotics  without  a  medical  prescription  and  requires  maintaining  quality standards  of  consumables,  including  food  and  meat.  The  National  Health  Policy, 2076 (2019) highlights the need to develop a national action plan to reduce AMR and effectively regulate and control the misuse of antibiotics. It is notable that the Nepal Health Sector Strategy 2015-2020 also identifies AMR as a public health challenge and implementation of One Health approach to address AMR.  Likewise, this National Action Plan builds on the 'One Health Strategy, 2076' (2019) endorsed by the Council of Ministers.

The National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance with the following strategic priorities has been developed to address the AMR problems nationally:

- 1. Improve awareness and understanding of AMR through effective communication, education, and training,
- 2. Strengthen the knowledge and evidence related to AMR through surveillance and research,
- 3. Reduce the incidence of infection through effective infection prevention and control,
- 4. Optimize the use of antimicrobial agents in the human, animal, and food sectors,
- 5. Ensure sustainable resources for the containment of AMR along with promoting investment in research and innovation.

## 2. Situation Analysis

## 2.1 AMR in humans and animals

Nepal  has  a  high  prevalence  of  infectious  and  communicable  diseases  that contribute to higher morbidity and mortality. Nepal is one of the 30 countries with a high prevalence of AMR in the world. According to the report on Nepal Burden of Disease, 2019, the most common infectious diseases include respiratory infections, tuberculosis, and typhoid infections, among  others. Increasing antimicrobial resistance makes the treatment of infections more challenging.

In  Nepal,  the  livestock  sector  alone  contributes  to  around  13%  of  the  national gross domestic product and over a quarter (27%) of the agricultural gross domestic product. With increasing demand for livestock products, livestock farming is growing at an annual rate of around 1.23%. Factors such as the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in animals and agriculture, poor husbandry practices, lack of awareness of good management practices (GMP), and irrational use of antibiotics have contributed to AMR development in the livestock sector.

## 2.1.1 Human health sector

Many  studies  on  antibiotic  prescribing  patterns  in  Nepal  have  shown  that  most patients  were  unnecessarily  prescribed  more  than  one  antibiotic  concurrently without bacterial confirmation or susceptibility testing. Antimicrobials are commonly prescribed for conditions that do not require antibiotics, such as colds, coughs, and diarrhoea. Moreover, self-medication is common in Nepal, and most people do not comply with the physician-directed duration of treatment. In addition, pharmaceutical  companies  with  vested  interests  offer  incentives  to  physicians  to prescribe 'their' brand of drugs.

According  to  a  study,  it  has  been  found  that  74.1%  of  hospitals  in  Nepal  do  not have wastewater treatment facilities. Another study showed that due to inadequate infection  prevention  and  control  practices,  and  monitoring  of  healthcare  quality

standards, healthcare-associated infections with highly resistant bacterial pathogens are rapidly increasing in hospitals.

Studies have shown a high prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in tertiary care hospitals in Kathmandu valley. Penicillin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoea  infection  is  also  on  the  rise  in  hospitals,  and  systematic  surveillance of AMR is needed to detect the emergence of resistant strains and guide effective treatment.  Recently,  it  has  been  found  that  most  antibiotics  are  becoming  less effective due to the development of resistance by bacteria. Amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and norfloxacin, which are used for Escherichia coli infections, are effective only in &lt;40% of cases, and even worse, are effective in &lt;20% of pneumonia cases caused by Klebsiella spp, studies indicate.

## 2.1.2 Animal health sector

Veterinary  medicines  and  feed  supplements  worth  tens  of  millions  of  rupees  are sold in Nepal every year.  According to a study, almost 13% of the total veterinary expenditure was under the category of 'antibiotics' . Likewise, another study shows the growing trends in antibiotic sales. Veterinary drugs are dispensed through para vets  or  retail  outlets  that  have  suboptimal  storage  facilities  and  personnel  with limited veterinary training. Studies in Nepal have found that retailers and distributors do not have adequate knowledge of the effective dosage and possible side effects of veterinary drugs. Tetracycline, enrofloxacin, neomycin-doxycycline, levofloxacin, colistin,  and  tylosin  are  the  most  commonly  consumed  antibiotics  in  Nepal,  with ampicillin, amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, and gentamicin being the most inappropriately prescribed ones.

Farmers use antibiotics in feed to compensate for poor farm sanitation and hygiene to get more returns. Owing to the ignorance regarding drug withdrawal periods and the negative impact on animal and human health, as well as long-term use, animal products  arriving  on  the  market  could  contain  antimicrobial  residues  above  the permitted level, which promotes the development of AMR. Safe and judicious use of antibiotics is still not practiced in dairy farms, and the risk to public health due to residues in milk is high. Studies have shown pork meat to be highly contaminated with antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter spp.; the high prevalence of AMR patterns in

avian pathogenic E. coli strains isolated from broiler chickens has also been revealed. These findings suggest the need for effective surveillance, monitoring mechanisms and interventions for controlling the misuse of antibiotics.

Studies  have  also  found  inadequate  regulations  and  guidelines  for  the  use of  veterinary  drugs  and  limited  AMR  surveillance  in  the  veterinary  field.  The Antibiotic Sensitivity Test reports from the Central Veterinary Laboratory (CVL) have demonstrated increasing resistance to a wide range of antibiotics. In a large annual sampling  from  different  locations  and  various  animals/products  (poultry,  buffalo meat, dairy farms products, and milk samples) (n = &gt;1,000), isolates including E. coli, S.  aureus, Streptococcus spp., Micrococcus, and Pasteurella were  found to be highly resistant  to  enrofloxacin,  amoxicillin,  and  colistin  sulphate  and  less  sensitive  to tetracycline, gentamicin, and levofloxacin.

Farmers commonly use antibiotics for farm animals without consulting veterinarians. Additionally, over-prescription, under-prescription, empirical antibiotic therapy, and irrational  prescription  of  broad-spectrum  antibiotics  (intended  for  rapid  cure)  by veterinarians have all contributed to antibiotic resistance. Veterinary health workers and paravets who prescribe medicines, including antibiotics, need to be provided with an orientation on AMR.

This is a broad overview of the AMR situation in Nepal. The following sections provide information regarding the AMR situation according to the strategic priorities of the action plan.

## 2.2 Awareness and understanding of AMR

The first  strategic  objective  of  the  NAP-AMR  is  to  address  AMR  by  improving  the awareness and understanding of AMR through effective communication, education, and training. All stakeholders, including the general population, need to be sensitized on  the 'One  Health'  approach  to  address  AMR. This  includes  understanding  and awareness  regarding  AMR,  antibiotics,  and  their  optimal  use.  The  'One  Health' approach for AMR containment targets the following sectors - human health, animal health  (including  agriculture/plant  health,  food,  and  feed),  and  the  environment. Incorporation of AMR and related topics in all relevant professional courses is also

included as a strategic intervention. This comprehensive approach simultaneously targets  the  general  population  of  farmers,  policymakers,  and  professionals  in  all relevant sectors. These professionals include those who are currently in service or private practice, along with those who will be starting their respective careers after the completion of their studies.

There is ample evidence that several factors play a role in the over-prescription or inappropriate  use  of  antibiotics  in  the  community.  These  include  patient-related issues,  interests  of  pharmaceutical  companies,  financial  incentives  for  prescribers or  drug  sellers  (pharmacists),  lack  of  knowledge  and  understanding  among  all stakeholders, peer pressure, poor healthcare systems, and gaps in regulations. A few studies conducted in Nepal have clearly shown that knowledge and awareness about common  health  problems,  medicines,  and  antibiotics  can  be  increased  through interventions among schoolteachers, school children, and drug retailers. A dedicated and systematic approach is needed to collect baseline data and information to guide targeted evidence-based interventions.

## 2.3 Surveillance of AMR

Surveillance is one of the primary measures to contain AMR. There are several reports and research studies on AMR patterns in Nepal, but these are limited to tertiary care hospitals and laboratories. As a result, they may not adequately reflect the overall antimicrobial susceptibility trends across the country.

Laboratory  surveillance  for  AMR  in  Nepal  started  as  early  as  1999  with  a  limited number of participating laboratories and few organisms. Since 2004, the NPHL has been conducting this program at the national level and has been designated as the National Coordinating Center (NCC) for AMR surveillance. The ten different organisms monitored  by  the  national  AMR  surveillance  program  included  Vibrio  cholerae, Shigella spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, N. gonorrhoeae, Salmonella typhi, and paratyphi, then in 2009, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli was also included. In 2013, MRSA was added, and in 2016, multidrug-resistant  (MDR)  Klebsiella  spp.  and  MDR  Acinetobacter  were  added  as well.  Currently,  26  sites  (hospitals/laboratories)  are  included  in  AMR  surveillance for 10 priority organisms, and the results are reported to the Global Antimicrobial

Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS). However, expansion of lab sites, upgrading of  laboratory  infrastructure,  and  training  of  human  resources  will  be  required  to tackle AMR.

In the veterinary sector, seven laboratories, including CVL, five provincial veterinary laboratories distributed across the country and  the National Avian Disease Investigation Laboratory in Chitwan participate in AMR surveillance of four priority bacteria  -  E.  coli,  Salmonella,  Enterococci  and  Campylobacter. There  is  a  need  to strengthen the reporting mechanism in the surveillance of AMR in the veterinary sector.

Studies have suggested that common bacteria isolated from animals in Nepal, such as  E.  coli,  Bacillus,  Campylobacter,  Salmonella,  Pseudomonas,  Staphylococci,  and Streptococci, have developed resistance against commonly used antimicrobials such as gentamicin, amoxicillin, enrofloxacin, ceftriaxone and even colistin. It is imperative to strengthen laboratories and scale up AMR surveillance and expand its scope to include samples from a wider spectrum of sources - including animal, environmental, and food samples - to align with the principles of a 'One Health' surveillance system. Further, it is important to link the data and information on surveillance of antibiotic use  and  consumption  with  lab-based  AMR  surveillance  for  developing  effective strategies to tackle the problem, especially at the institutional level.

## 2.4 Infection prevention and control

The infection prevention and control (IPC) program is a key intervention for containing AMR. Functional IPC programs reduce the rates of healthcare-associated infections and volume of antimicrobial consumption (AMC) and are vital in preventing AMR. Although infection prevention and control in healthcare settings is included as one of  the  components in the Minimum Service Standards (MSS) for hospitals, not all hospitals have functional IPC programs. Only a few hospitals have developed their own IPC policy and have formed IPC committees. Although infection prevention and control applies primarily to healthcare facilities, it also involves infection prevention at the population level. Therefore, a multisectoral coordination is necessary.

Nepal has a good immunization coverage of &gt;80%. At present, 10 vaccines against 13  types  of  antigens  are  being  provided  free  of  charge  through  the  National Immunization Program in Nepal. Vaccines help reduce the incidence of infections, and, consequently, reduce the need to use antimicrobials. Similarly, IPC programs are needed at all animal health facilities. In animals, vaccines against bacterial infections such as hemorrhagic septicemia, black quarter and anthrax in cattle and buffalo, and cholera and mycoplasma-mediated disease in fowls have decreased the incidence of infections, thereby reducing antibiotic use.

This  NAP  contributes  to  carrying  out  these  programs  effectively  and  responsibly through  infection  prevention  systems  with  biosafety  and  biosecurity  in the laboratories  and  through  compliance  with  the  IPC  guidelines  in  the  healthcare facilities.

## 2.5 Optimum use of antimicrobials

One of the main drivers of AMR is the inappropriate use of antibiotics. Overuse of antibiotics, their intake without medical prescription, ignorance of full course, doses, self-medication  practices,  untimely  use,  and  misuse  make  the  microorganisms resistant  to  antibiotics.    Therefore,  the  optimal  use  of  antibiotics  in  the  human, animal, livestock, food, and feed sectors, and proper disposal of antimicrobials from manufacturing units, healthcare facilities, farms, and residential areas are important. Unless all stakeholders are aware of the need to optimize the use of antibiotics and understand the 'One Health' nature of AMR and the extent of resistance, behaviour changes to ensure the appropriate use of  antimicrobials  will  remain  challenging. Regular and effective surveillance of the antimicrobial consumption (AMC) pattern contributes to ensuring the optimal use of antibiotics.

Despite  antibiotics  being  prescription  drugs  in  Nepal  as  per  the  Drug  Act  2035 (1978), they are freely available over the counter for human or animal use. Although standard treatment guidelines (STGs) were endorsed by the MoHP in 2014, they are not being used widely, as shown by various studies. However, the revised version of the STGs was approved in 2023.

In Nepal, the drug regulatory authority responsible for licensing as well as monitoring the quality of antibiotics is the Department of Drug Administration (DDA). The DDA also  regularly  audits  samples  (medicines)  from  the  market  (retail  pharmacies)  for substandard  quality  or  counterfeits.  However,  there  is  no  active  surveillance  on antibiotic consumption or their appropriate prescription.

The  Veterinary  Standards  and  Drug  Regulatory  Laboratory  (VSDRL)  under  the Department of Livestock Services (DLS) regulates veterinary drug use and veterinary vaccines  imported  into  the  country.  It  also  serves  as  an  OIE  focal  laboratory  for reporting the antimicrobials used in animals. Recently, the DLS banned the use of antibiotics for growth promotion in pre-mix feeds, but a monitoring system to check and enforce the ban is not that effective.

Currently, there are 55 domestic pharmaceutical companies producing antibiotics in Nepal.  Among  these,  eight  companies  also  manufacture  drugs,  including antibiotics, for the animal sector. However, only 28 companies are certified as Good Manufacturing  Practices  (GMP)  compliant,  and  among  them,  only  one  company produces drugs for animals.

The 50th meeting of the Drug Advisory committee has recommended an immediate ban on the import of colistin for use in animal feed to the DDA. The surveillance of antibiotic residues in food products such as meat, milk, and fish, is the responsibility of the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control (DFTQC), which conducts residue  testing  for  selected  chemicals  including  antibiotic  residues.  DFTQC  has  a structure set up with a testing facility for antibiotic residue in its National Food and Feed Reference Laboratory (NFFRL). The National Food Safety Policy- 2076 (2019) has been approved by the Government of Nepal, which focuses on developing standards (Maximum Residue Level) for drug residues in animal-origin foods.

## 2.6 Investment, research, and innovation

Globally, new antibiotics are being developed continually, but they are thought to be insufficient to mitigate the growing antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, conserving the effectiveness of available antimicrobials is the need of the hour. There is a need to conduct further studies and research to devise strategies to protect the newer antimicrobials from resistance and use them judiciously.

Operational research on antibiotic resistance, the use and consumption of antibiotics, awareness and understanding of AMR  and  antibiotics, infection prevention and  control,  behavioural  changes  in  antibiotic  consumption,  and  antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) is required.

It  is  necessary  to  conduct  studies  to  understand  the  behaviour,  incentive,  and capacity of all the stakeholders and to develop and implement innovative strategies. Considering the rich cultural heritage and ancient knowledge of herbal medicines, in vitro and in vivo studies are necessary for developing alternatives to antimicrobials for humans, animals as well as agriculture.

Multi-stakeholder engagement in studies, research, and innovation, aligned with the 'One Health' approach, and the direct involvement of all three tiers of government, according  to  their  authorities  and  responsibilities  under  federalism,  as  well  as development partners including the WHO, can be seen as further opportunities to contain AMR.

## 3. Country Response

## 3.1 Developing the National Action Plan on AMR

This  NAP  has  been  developed  with  high-level  political  commitment  with  multistakeholder  engagement  and  in  line  with  the  'One  Health'  strategy  to  combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

The National Health Policy, 2076 (2019) has prioritized the containment of AMR as a major health agenda. The National Steering Committee - AMR, and the National Technical Working Committee (NTWC) - AMR haven been formed to respond to the issue of AMR institutionally. Similarly, various thematic committees have also been provisioned for the implementation of the activities within the strategic interventions.

During the development of the NAP-AMR, each sector conducted sectoral meetings with representation from all relevant stakeholders for the containment of AMR on each strategic objective and drafted sector-wise interventions, and activities, with a timeline and key outputs. The sectoral drafts were compiled, and the compiled draft was discussed within the NTWC-AMR. The inputs and recommendations received from the discussion were incorporated into the draft which was then submitted to the  Steering  Committee-AMR  for  approval. The  suggestions  and  inputs  from  the Steering  Committee  were  also  incorporated  into  the  draft  before  sharing  it  with the Ministry of Finance and the National Planning Commission for their input and suggestions. The final draft that incorporated their feedback was then submitted to the cabinet for endorsement.

## 3.2 Governance Mechanism

The  mechanisms  listed  below  are  in  place  with  the  representation  of  relevant stakeholders for the implementation, feedback, monitoring, and evaluation of this action plan. These mechanisms will carry out the effective implementation of the NAP-AMR, provide insights for the formulation of policy and plan formulation, and aid  in  resolving  implementation  challenges.  The  human  resources  required  for

## 6. Cost Estimate and Management of Financial Resources

The Ministry of Health and Population, with the support from WHO, has prepared a cost estimate for this Action Plan. The total cost estimate for the implementation of this Action Plan is estimated to be NRs. 4,586 million. The total cost estimate is then disaggregated into five fiscal years. The cost allocation, therefore, is as follows: NRs. 1,132 million for the first year, NRs. 1,118 million for the second year, NRs. 1,085 million for the third year, NRs. 599 million for the fourth year, and NRs. 650 million for the fifth year. Out of the total cost estimate for five years, around two-thirds (61 percent) of the cost will be spent at the federal level, 12 percent will be spent at the provincial level, and 27 percent will be spent at the local level. Of the total cost estimated for implementation of this Action Plan, based on the strategic priority sectors, the first strategic priority will have 15 percent, the second strategic priority will have 28 percent, the third strategic priority will have 41 percent, the fourth strategic priority will have 12 percent, and the fifth strategic priority will have 4 percent of the cost.

Similarly, to implement activities for the four sectors spelled out in this Action plan (human health, animal health, food, and environment), it is estimated that NRs. 2,065 million will be spent on the human health sector, NRs. 1,996 million will be spent on animal health, NRs. 416 million will be spent on the food sector and NRs. 109 million will be spent on the environment sector. For the implementation of the Action Plan, the Government of Nepal, provincial governments, and local governments will manage the resources. Similarly, financial support will also be sought from the development partners and the non-government organizations for the implementation of this Action Plan. For the implementation of the activities outlined in the Action Plan, the concerned ministries/ sectors and their tier of the government will manage the required budget in their annual plans for the implementation of activities falling under their sector.

## 7. Provisions Related to Monitoring and Evaluation

The National Steering Committee will be responsible for monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the Action Plan lie with. The monitoring and evaluation of the Action Plan will be a continuous process throughout the implementation period. The National Steering Committee may carry out monitoring and evaluation activities through  the  National  Technical  Working  Committee.  Similarly,  with  regard  to  the provincial and local level, the concerned province and local level may form a monitoring and evaluation committee as required to regularly monitor the implementation.

The monitoring and evaluation may also be carried out through an electronic system as required. The review report related to monitoring and evaluation from all sectors of 'One Health' and the federal, provincial, and local levels will be submitted to the National Steering Committee through the National Technical Working Committee. The monitoring and evaluation report will be submitted in the approved prescribed format. The format related to monitoring and evaluation has been provided in Annex 3.

## 8. Provisions Related to Reporting

All sectors of 'One Health' and the committees at all levels will submit progress reports annually to the National Steering Committee. The format for the report to be submitted from the local, provincial, and sectoral committees will be approved by the National Steering Committee. The report according to this approved format will be submitted by the local level to the province, the province and the sectoral committee to the National Technical Working Committee. The National Technical Working Committee will submit the compiled report received from all levels to the National Steering Committee.

## 9. Risks

There is a risk  of  facing  difficulty  in  regard  to  the  implementation  of  the  strategies identified by this action plan if the financial resources cannot be managed adequately and  infrastructure development,  improvement  in  organizational  structure,  and management of  human  resources  cannot  be  carried  out  in  a  timely  manner.  Also, the  implementation  may  be  at  risk  if  there  is  a  lack  of  effective  coordination  and collaboration.

The  risk  associated  with  the  financial  resources  will  be  primarily  managed  by  the Government  of  Nepal,  the  federal,  provincial,  and  local  governments  through  the allocation of budget in their respective annual programs for the implementation of the activities listed in this Action Plan. Similarly, the provision put forth by the Action Plan  for  financial  support  from  the  development  partners  and  non-government organizations will also further support in mitigating the risk posed by the financial resource limitations.

The risk  will  be  mitigated  through  the  implementation  of  this  Action  Plan  through the  coordination  and  collaboration  among  all  stakeholders  and  sectors  and  the development  of  infrastructure  and  improvement  in  organizational  structures  in  a timely manner.

## 10. Modification in Annex
