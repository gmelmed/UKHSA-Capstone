## Executive Summary

The National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (CARB), 2020-2025, presents coordinated, strategic actions that the United States Government will take in the next five years to improve the health and wellbeing of all Americans by changing the course of antibiotic resistance.

This Plan is based on the U.S. Government's 2014 National Strategy for CARB, and builds on the first National Action Plan released in 2015 by expanding evidence-based activities that have already been shown to reduce antibiotic resistance, such as optimizing the use of antibiotics in human and animal health settings.

This Plan continues to prioritize infection prevention and control to slow the spread of resistant infections and reduce the need for antibiotic use. To ensure that patients receive the right antibiotic care, the Plan supports innovative approaches to developing and deploying diagnostic tests and treatment strategies. A One Health approach, which recognizes the relationships between the health of humans, animals, plants, and the environment, is integrated throughout the Plan, with an expanded effort to understand antibiotic resistance in the environment. The Plan also focuses on collecting and using data to better understand where resistance is occurring, support the development of new diagnostics and treatment options, and advance international coordination.

The U.S. Government will report annually on progress toward the objectives set in the Plan.

## About the National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, 2020-2025

This Plan describes activities that the U.S. Government will undertake from 2020 through 2025 to reduce the impact of antibiotic and antimicrobial resistance on the nation. 1

<!-- image -->

To address the growing threat of antibiotic resistance, the U.S. Government released the National Strategy for CARB in September 2014, which outlined five inter-related goals to guide Federal action. At the same time, Executive Order 13676 established the Federal Task Force for CARB to identify actions to implement the National Strategy. In March 2015, the Task Force released the first National Action Plan for CARB, aimed at moving the nation toward the goals of the National Strategy through specific objectives, strategies, and milestones to be achieved within 1, 3, and 5 years. The Task Force has issued reports on progress toward these milestones for years 1 and 2, year 3, and year 4 of the original plan. A forthcoming final report will cover year 5 and an overall assessment of progress.

The new National Action Plan for 2020-2025, presented here, maintains the original 5 goals of the National Strategy and includes new objectives and targets aimed at achieving those goals.

The Task Force is co-chaired by the Secretaries of the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Agriculture (USDA), and Defense (DoD), and also includes the Departments of Interior (DoI), State (DoS), and Veterans Affairs (VA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the National Science Foundation, and representatives from the Executive Office of the President. The HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation coordinates the Task Force, prepares annual progress reports, and led the development of this document.

The Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (PACCARB), also established by Executive Order 13676, is composed of both Federal and non-Federal subject-matter experts in human and agricultural health. The PACCARB provides information and recommendations to the HHS Secretary regarding programs and policies to combat antibiotic resistance and to improve capabilities to prevent, diagnose, mitigate, or treat antibiotic-resistant infections. 2

## Background

## The Threat of Antibiotic Resistance

The landmark discovery of the first modern antibiotics in the early 20 th  century contributed to historic improvements in human health and life expectancy. Along with improved sanitation systems, hygiene, and vaccination, antibiotics and other medicines have greatly reduced the incidence of deaths from bacterial infections. However, these advances must not be taken for granted, because microbial pathogens continually evolve new ways to evade the drugs designed to kill them. Pathogens and their drug-defeating genes can also be transferred among humans, animals, and the environment. The evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance challenge our continued ability to prevent and treat infectious diseases in humans and animals.

Antibiotic-resistant infections can also complicate the response to and recovery from public health emergencies. For example, during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, many patients acquired secondary bacterial infections in addition to influenza, and some of these infections were resistant to antibiotics. While the implications of antibiotic resistance are not yet clear for the ongoing response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and associated COVID-19 illness, increased use of antibiotics and other antimicrobial medicines-both appropriate and inappropriate-to address primary or secondary infections has the potential to further accelerate the emergence of antibiotic resistance.

In 2013, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on the most worrisome antibiotic-resistant threats in the U.S., sounding the national alarm and identifying necessary actions to face these threats. In 2019, the CDC updated these national estimates and found that each year, more than 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections occur in the United States, resulting in the deaths of more than 35,000 Americans. Although the total economic impact of antibiotic resistance is difficult to determine, the CDC estimates that just a subset of resistant infections caused more than $4.8 billion in medical costs in 2017. 3 Similarly, antibiotic-resistant pathogens can harm animal health, though the scope of resistance in animals is less well characterized than in humans. Antibiotic resistance is a challenging threat, but aggressive actions now can prolong the effectiveness of existing antibiotics and prevent infections in the future, ultimately saving lives and money.

## The U.S. Government Response

The U.S. Government is responding to antibiotic resistance with a comprehensive and coordinated suite of actions implemented by a diverse set of agencies using a One Health approach. The National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (CARB) lays out five goals to reduce the incidence and impact of antibiotic-resistant infections:

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Goal 1: Slow the Emergence of Resistant Bacteria and Prevent the Spread of Resistant Infections

Goal 2: Strengthen National One Health Surveillance Efforts to Combat Resistance

Goal 3: Advance Development and Use of Rapid and Innovative Diagnostic Tests for Identification and Characterization of Resistant Bacteria

Goal 4: Accelerate Basic and Applied Research and Development for New Antibiotics, Other Therapeutics, and Vaccines

Goal 5: Improve International Collaboration and Capacities for Antibiotic-resistance Prevention, Surveillance, Control and Antibiotic Research and Development.

These goals are pursued by the Federal Departments and Agencies of the CARB Task Force, which is cochaired by the Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Agriculture, and Defense. In 2015, the Task Force launched the first National Action Plan for CARB, and substantial progress has been made in the past five years. Working with local, State, tribal, territorial, and international partners, the U.S. Government has:

- ● Established a new national Antibiotic Resistance Laboratory Network (AR Lab Network);
- ● Launched a strategic initiative to support antibiotic stewardship in veterinary settings;
- ● Developed new programs to improve antibiotic use across healthcare settings;
- ● Launched a biopharmaceutical accelerator, CARB-X;
- ● Supported the development and approval of new diagnostic and treatment options;
- ● Pursued alternatives to antibiotics in agriculture; and
- ● Obtained hundreds of commitments to global action from a broad range of sectors and stakeholders.

One Health is a collaborative, multisectoral, and transdisciplinary approach-working at the local, regional, national, and global levels-with the goal of achieving optimal health outcomes by recognizing the interconnection between people, animals, plants, and their shared environment.

Human, animal, plant, and environmental health are all connected  The antibiotics used to treat infections . may be the same or similar in humans and animals; the manufacture, use, and disposal of antibiotics in all settings can potentially drive the emergence of resistance. When antibiotic-resistant bacteria arise, they may spread among humans, animals, and the environment. A One Health approach recognizes the interconnectedness between the health of people, animals, plants, and the environment and encourages a collaborative response to the threat of antibiotic resistance. The CARB Task Force employs a One Health approach by engaging U.S. Government agencies that oversee human, animal, and environmental health and by promoting collaboration and communication to address antibiotic resistance in every relevant sector.

Collaborations among U.S. Government Departments and Agencies have produced important efforts to fight antibiotic resistance. For example, the strong relationship between USDA and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within HHS led to an innovative strategy to help ensure that medically important antibiotic drugs (those that are important for therapeutic use in humans) fed to food-producing animals are limited to uses necessary for assuring animal health. FDA sought broad public input and engaged affected stakeholders over several years on plans to work with pharmaceutical companies to voluntarily withdraw production uses (e.g., growth promotion, increased feed efficiency) of medically important antibiotics and to require veterinary oversight of their remaining therapeutic uses. FDA and USDA jointly participated in workshops across the U.S. that brought together producers, veterinarians, and feed suppliers to create a shared understanding of these new initiatives and to discuss the management challenges to implementing them. All pharmaceutical companies with affected products agreed to adopt FDA's judicious use approach, withdrew affected drugs from the market, and fully implemented the recommended changes by the threeyear target. In 2019, FDA reported a 38 percent decline between 2015 and 2018 in medically important antibiotics sold for use in food-producing animals. USDA continues to monitor antibiotic use practices on farm, as well as other practices used to address animal health challenges through national studies of animal agriculture. These studies will help experts understand the effects of FDA policy changes on producers. USDA also conducts and funds research to find effective alternatives to antibiotics and other interventions to help maintain animal health and welfare, food security, and agriculture sustainability.

Recognizing that domestic action alone is insufficient, the U.S. Government works with multisectoral organizations, partner nations, the private sector, civil society, and other stakeholders to address the threat of antibiotic resistance. Internationally, the U.S. Government has helped to secure high-level commitments to address antibiotic resistance by national leaders, organizations, and Ministers. These commitments include the development and adoption of the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance, the Declaration of the United Nations High Level Meeting on Antimicrobial Resistance, commitments made at the G7 and G20 meetings, and additional actions by the WHO, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).

## The National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, 2020-2025

Efforts to reduce the effects of antibiotic resistance are working: from 2012 to 2017, the overall number of U.S. deaths from antibiotic-resistant infections fell by 18 percent, and the number of U.S. deaths from resistant infections in hospitals fell by nearly 30 percent as a result of efforts to prevent infections and control their spread. However, antibiotic resistance continues to harm too many Americans, and worrisome trends are emerging, including the discovery of new resistant pathogens, such as Candida auris, and an increase in resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections. Other drug-resistant, community-acquired bacterial infections from group A Streptococcus and ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, for example, are also increasing. The U.S. Government is therefore committed to sustained and enhanced work to combat antibiotic resistance.

In September 2018, the CARB Task Force began developing an updated National Action Plan for CARB, which would cover activities in the years 2020 through 2025. The Task Force reviewed prior efforts and anticipated future challenges and opportunities. The PACCARB solicited and reported on public input, which the Task Force considered alongside perspectives from Federal experts. The result is a set of coordinated, strategic actions aimed at changing the trajectory of antibiotic resistance and improving the health and wellbeing of all Americans, as well as the health of animals, plants, and the environment.

Many of the actions build on and expand evidence-based activities initiated under the 2015-2020 National Action Plan for CARB that have already shown impact, such as the appropriate use of antibiotics in human health, animal health, and in the environment. The Task Force continues to consider infection prevention and control, especially within healthcare facilities, to be high priorities, to both slow the spread of antibioticresistant infections and to reduce the need for antibiotic use. Many actions focus on collecting data and turning it into information that can be used to better understand where resistance is occurring, to support the development of new diagnostics and treatment options, and to advance international coordination.

Implementing the activities outlined in this plan will depend on the availability of resources and capacity. The new National Action Plan for CARB, 2020-2025, does not exhaustively list all Federal activities that address antibiotic resistance. Rather, it includes the continuing and new actions that are considered the highest priority for reducing antibiotic resistance in the next five years.

## Measuring and Reporting Progress

The 2020 Plan maintains the original five goals of the 2014 National Strategy but establishes a new set of objectives to move the country toward those goals. Whereas the 2015 plan included 1-, 3-, and 5-year milestones meant to capture the activities of specific Federal Departments and Agencies, the 2020 plan includes targets, many of which are composites of multiple activities pursued by multiple agencies. Each listed Department and Agency will report on progress toward these targets within the relevant timeframe. Where possible, the 2020 Plan has established targets to be achieved by 2021, with some targets set for longer timeframes. Each annual report on this Plan will provide updated or added targets as relevant along with rationale for these changes. For example, the first annual report might note that a 2021 target has been achieved and establish a new 2022 target for that objective.

Task Force members reviewed the barriers faced in the past five years while implementing the 2015 Plan and anticipated challenges over the next five years. Certain challenges apply to all five goals, including the allocation of limited resources, obstacles to data gathering and sharing, and uncertainty about the participation of research and industry partners. Implementing the activities outlined in this plan will depend on the availability of resources and capacity. The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated redirection of publichealth, infection control, and antibiotic stewardship resources and will continue to affect implementation of the activities described here. In future annual progress reports, the CARB Task Force will discuss challenges encountered during the preceding year, how it addressed these challenges, and any new challenges identified. Specific challenges are also noted for each Goal below. Appendix B lists all the Challenges.

In most cases, the CARB Task Force will not have direct evidence that the activities listed in this plan cause changes in relevant outcomes. This is because important human, animal, plant, and environmental health metrics are influenced by a variety of interdependent factors, making it difficult to establish single causeand-effect relationships between specific activities and specific outcomes. However, tracking progress toward the targets listed here should inform the Task Force's understanding of relevant changes over time, allowing agencies to change course when necessary to more effectively achieve the objectives and make progress toward the goals.

Work under the 2015 Plan has clarified the Task Force's understanding of the challenges inherent in collecting and analyzing the data needed to combat antibiotic resistance. The 2020 Plan therefore designates several 'Data Development' objectives that aim to develop new or improved data infrastructure, collection, or analysis options. Appendix A lists the Data Development strategies.

The Task Force will continue to report annually on progress, including challenges identified and actions taken to address those challenges. The Task Force may make changes to objectives or targets to accommodate potential new data sources or other unforeseen but informative changes to this work. These changes and their rationale will be included in annual reports.

Goal 1

<!-- image -->

## Slow the Emergence of Resistant Bacteria and Prevent the Spread of Resistant Infections

Bacteria and fungi have developed unique mechanisms to resist the effects of antibiotics and antifungals, and continual evolution of antibiotic resistance is inevitable. However, the development of resistance can be slowed and its effects on human and animal health can be minimized. One way to achieve this is through primary prevention of infections through infection control and other interventions. Using antibiotics only when needed in humans and animals reduces the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and extends the effectiveness of current antibiotics. Appropriate antibiotic use also minimizes potential healthcare-related harms to patients, such as adverse drug events and the overgrowth of harmful bacteria (e.g., Clostridioides difficile infection, which causes severe diarrhea, toxic colon inflammation, and sometimes death). The objectives below build on recent improvements in infection prevention and control that have saved lives, particularly in hospital settings.

## Anticipated Challenges

Prevention and containment efforts, along with improved use of antibiotics, can slow the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes and antibiotic-resistant pathogens and can limit their impact on humans and animals. However, many challenges to these efforts exist. Some of these challenges are related to changing behaviors to ensure optimal infection-control practices and appropriate prescribing of antibiotics. Others could be part of identifying and scaling up best practices across spectrums of care, ensuring their continuity, and coordinating these practices across One Health. Still others could be related to engaging all relevant stakeholders for buy-in and support of best practices.

Antibiotic resistance is unquestionably a One Health issue, impacting the health of humans, animals, plants, and the environment. Efforts to identify antibiotic-resistant organisms, track the spread of resistance, and measure the effect of antibiotic use require surveillance across human, animal, and plant populations and the environment, as well as collaboration from the U.S. Government agencies and partners across each of these settings. The following objectives aim to create a stronger coordinated national One Health effort with more extensive surveillance of antibiotic use and resistance to combat this threat.

## Anticipated Challenges

Challenges to strengthening the national infrastructure for surveillance of antibiotic use and resistance could arise when encouraging local, State, and private partners and stakeholders to collect and share data across the human, animal, plant, and environmental (e.g., water, soil) sectors. Enhancing training and testing capacities will require laboratories to maintain ongoing support for staff, continuously maintain their testing equipment, and advance their testing methodologies. The cost-effectiveness and quality of testing (including whole-genome sequencing) depends on appropriate assignment of laboratory roles and responsibilities in accordance with expertise and capacity. Improving electronic surveillance will be necessary for efficient, timely, and consistent submission of data from frontline sources to and across Federal Departments and Agencies. Many challenges are inherent to these activities, such as those associated with sharing electronic data on antibiotic use and resistance, developing and implementing minimum data-quality standards of measurement, and ensuring enough resources to support isolate and data repositories. Federal Departments and Agencies will need to write new policies and processes for the secure and confidential storage and sharing of data. Success in these activities will require extensive, coordinated, and comprehensive efforts by all partners across One Health.

Goal 3

Advance Development and Use of Rapid and Innovative Diagnostic Tests for Identification and Characterization of Resistant Bacteria

New diagnostic tests are urgently needed to detect antibiotic resistance and to improve surveillance, the control of infections, and treatment decision-making by providers. One major impediment to introducing new diagnostics is a lack of research on their appropriate use in clinical and veterinary care and a lack of point-of-care antibiotic resistance diagnostics in outpatient settings. More information is needed to determine the impact of diagnostics on improving the use of antibiotics and related outcomes in humans and animals, to identify circumstances in which specific diagnostics improve outcomes, and to identify best practices for integrating diagnostics into relevant decision-making processes. Finally, there is a critical need to leverage existing capabilities to promote the validation, adoption, and appropriate use of new and currently available diagnostics.

## Anticipated Challenges

When companies develop new diagnostic tests, they face challenges such as the high cost of some components of the tests, technical difficulties in preparing and obtaining clinical samples, and pathogendrug interactions. Limited return on investment for new diagnostics is also a significant challenge. Determining the appropriate use of new and existing diagnostic tools requires an engaged response from the research community. Once diagnostics are developed, stimulating their appropriate adoption and use requires the creation of evidence-based guidelines and appropriate reimbursement policies, an often protracted and complex process.

## Objective 1

Develop and validate new diagnostics.

## Objective 1.1

Develop new or enhance existing diagnostics that use isolates and primary samples to determine the presence, severity, or antimicrobial susceptibility or resistance of bacterial or fungal infections and to identify appropriate treatment.

<!-- image -->

Antibiotic effectiveness is continually reduced through the evolution of antibiotic resistance, requiring support for basic and applied research as part of a comprehensive One Health strategy. Research can improve our understanding of the many factors that contribute to the emergence, spread, and persistence of antibiotic resistance and can support new strategies for preventing and mitigating infections. Prolonging the effectiveness of an existing drug depends on research to determine its optimal dose, duration, regimen, and drug combinations. The pipeline of new antibiotics must be continually primed through discovery and development research. In addition, research on alternatives to antibiotics, including bacteriophages, monoclonal antibodies, immune modulators, and phytochemicals, suggests that these products can help prevent and treat infections in humans and animals without promoting antibiotic resistance. Effective vaccines that prevent infection may also reduce use of antibiotics, thereby avoiding resistance. Research on other innovative products (e.g., live biotherapeutics, including microbiome-based products, prophylactic monoclonal antibodies, and decolonizing agents) could expand the range of strategies and help reduce the impact of antibiotic resistance. Developing therapeutic and preventative products (including those directed at decolonization) requires intensified efforts to support basic research, turn discoveries into products, and facilitate clinical trials. The final objective of Goal 4 aims to promote the economic sustainability of the antibiotics market through collaboration with the private sector.

## Anticipated Challenges

Across One Health, the multi-year process to develop new antibiotics, therapeutics, and vaccines includes a high rate of attrition within the discovery pipeline. Discovery of new classes of antibiotics with activity against gram-negative bacteria is also very challenging, and the development pathways for most nonantibiotic therapeutics remain uncharted. Additionally, the lag time between completing and publishing the results of basic and applied research studies can delay their real-world impact.

In addition to the targeted objectives of Goal 4 listed below, the U.S. Government will pursue several broad activities to accelerate research on antibiotic resistance.

## Activity 1

As outlined in the National Biodefense Strategy, the U.S. Government Global Health Security Strategy, and in accordance with the U.S. Government's engagement through the Global Health Security Agenda, the U.S. Government works to enhance the capacities of governments, civil society, academia, and the private sector in partner countries and the international community to address the emergence, spread, and impact of antibiotic resistance. To do this, rapidly detecting and containing antibiotic-resistant pathogens through enhanced laboratory networks is critical. Several objectives within this goal build on existing international research collaborations to combat antibiotic resistance. Concerted efforts to align resources internationally could support clinical trials to evaluate new products and provide data on the best way to use existing products. These efforts would also promote the translational development of diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines, support research to understand the development and spread of antibiotic resistance, identify risk factors linked to human health outcomes, and generate mitigation strategies.

## Anticipated Challenges

Developing global consensus around updates to international guidance can be a difficult and protracted effort. Also difficult is the process of supporting the efforts of partner countries to better identify the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. Establishing a well-functioning international network that can detect and respond to antibiotic resistance requires substantial and well-aligned resources, including the ability to tap experts to help with the containment of resistance. Alternatively, a global network could focus on high-value locations, such as those with a high risk for developing outbreaks of new high-threat pathogens and with frequent embarkation points for travel to the U.S.

## Appendix B: Challenges

## Anticipated Challenges to Implementing the National Action Plan for CARB, 2020-2025

As the Task Force drafted the 2020 Plan, its members reviewed the barriers faced in the past five years while implementing the 2015 Plan and anticipated challenges over the next five years. Certain challenges apply to all five goals, including the allocation of limited resources, obstacles to data gathering and sharing, and uncertainty about the participation of research and industry partners. Implementing the activities outlined in this plan will depend on the availability of resources and capacity. The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated redirection of public-health, infection-control, and antibiotic stewardship resources and will continue to affect implementation of the activities described here. In future annual progress reports, the CARB Task Force will discuss challenges encountered during the preceding year, how it addressed these challenges, and any new challenges identified.

## Goal 1: Slow the Emergence of Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria and Prevent the Spread of Resistant Infections

Prevention and containment efforts, along with improved use of antibiotics, can slow the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes and antibiotic-resistant pathogens and can limit their impact on humans and animals. However, many challenges to these efforts exist. Some of these challenges are related to changing behaviors to ensure optimal infection-control practices and appropriate prescribing of antibiotics. Others could be part of identifying and scaling up best practices across spectrums of care, ensuring their continuity, and coordinating these practices across One Health. Still others could be related to engaging all relevant stakeholders for buy-in and support of best practices.

## Goal 2: Strengthen National One Health Capacity and Surveillance Efforts to Combat Antibiotic Resistance

Challenges to strengthening the national infrastructure for surveillance of antibiotic use and resistance could arise when encouraging local, State, and private partners and stakeholders to collect and share data across the human, animal, plant, and environmental (e.g., water, soil) sectors. Enhancing training and testing capacities will require laboratories to maintain ongoing support for staff, continuously maintain their testing equipment, and advance their testing methodologies. The cost-effectiveness and quality of testing (including whole-genome sequencing) depends on appropriate assignment of laboratory roles and responsibilities in accordance with expertise and capacity. Improving electronic surveillance will be necessary for efficient, timely, and consistent submission of data from frontline sources to and across Federal Departments and Agencies. Many challenges are inherent to these activities, such as those associated with sharing electronic data on antibiotic use and resistance, developing and implementing minimum data-quality standards of measurement, and ensuring enough resources to support isolate and data repositories. Federal Departments and Agencies will need to write new policies and processes for the secure and confidential storage and sharing of data. Success in these activities will require extensive, coordinated, and comprehensive efforts by all partners across One Health.

## Goal 3: Advance the Development and Use of Rapid and Innovative Diagnostic Tests for Identifying and Characterizing Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria

When companies develop new diagnostic tests, they face challenges such as the high cost of some components of the tests, technical difficulties in preparing and obtaining clinical samples, and pathogendrug interactions. Limited return on investment for new diagnostics is also a significant challenge. Determining the appropriate use of new and existing diagnostic tools requires an engaged response from the research community. Once diagnostics are developed, stimulating their appropriate adoption and use requires the creation of evidence-based guidelines and appropriate reimbursement policies, an often protracted and complex process.

## Goal 4: Accelerate Basic and Applied Research to Develop New Antibiotics, Therapeutics, and Vaccines

Across One Health, the multi-year process to develop new antibiotics, therapeutics, and vaccines includes a high rate of attrition within the discovery pipeline. Discovery of new classes of antibiotics with activity against gram-negative bacteria is also very challenging, and the development pathways for most nonantibiotic therapeutics remain uncharted. Additionally, the lag time between completing and publishing the results of basic and applied research studies can delay their real-world impact.

## Goal 5: Improve International Collaboration and Capacities for Preventing, Tracking, and Controlling Antibiotic Resistance and for Antibiotic Research and Development

Developing global consensus around updates to international guidance can be a difficult and protracted effort. Also difficult is the process of supporting the efforts of partner countries to better identify the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. Establishing a well-functioning international network that can detect and respond to antibiotic resistance requires substantial and well-aligned resources, including the ability to tap experts to help with the containment of resistance. Alternatively, a global network could focus on high-value locations, such as those with a high risk for developing outbreaks of new high-threat pathogens and with frequent embarkation points for travel to the U.S.
