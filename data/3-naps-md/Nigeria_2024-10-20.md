## Foreword

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is no longer an emerging global challenge. It is an established global crisis that requires urgent action and innovative approaches to encourage the prudent use of antimicrobials, promote infection prevention measures, and improve access to diagnostics and therapeutics.

This National Action Plan (NAP) 2.0 establishes the Nigerian government's commitment to tackle AMR over the next five years from 2024 to 2028. It is designed to build upon and sustain the achievements made in the AMR NAP 1.0, which was implemented from 2017 to 2023. The AMR NAP 2.0 also seeks to address areas where we did not attain our desired goals over the last five years, directly focusing on barriers to progress.

Collectively, as Nigeria's One Health Ministries, we recognise that the success of this action plan requires deep, consistent, and coordinated collaboration across sectors, and thus we are committed to supporting its  implementation  through  our  mandates.  This multisectoral  and multidimensional  AMR  NAP  2.0 provides  strategic  direction  and  guidance  on addressing AMR, developed  through  the  successful synthesis of AMR stakeholders' expertise, data, information, experiences, and best practices; this makes it a comprehensive nationwide blueprint to maximise efforts and reduce fragmentation. It also addresses gaps and challenges, priority interventions, and the scope of investments so that every stakeholder can join hands in containing and reducing the impact of AMR across Nigeria.

The  AMR  NAP  2.0 cannot  be  implemented  successfully  without  contributions  from  all  sectors  and partners. Therefore, we call on all ministries, agencies, and departments as well as development partners, the private sector, civil society, and other non-governmental actors to come together and align their interventions and activities to directly support the effective implementation of this plan.

Further,  the  AMR  NAP 2.0 aligns  with and supports the fulfilment of  other  national strategic  plans including  the  Health  Sector  Renewal  Investment  Initiative  Agenda and  the  National  Action  Plan  for Health Security (NAPHS) of the Federal Ministry of Health; the National Agricultural Technology and Innovation Policy 2022-2027 of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security; and the National Policy on AMR and its corresponding Strategic Plan of the Federal Ministry of Environment.

While we acknowledge that the complexity of the AMR crisis cannot be fully addressed in a five-year plan, we look forward to achieving our goals and set targets over this period to build on our existing achievements and strengthen Nigeria's progress against the global threat of AMR.

## Acknowledgements

The Government of Nigeria recognises and appreciates the technical and financial support provided by multisectoral national and international stakeholders in the development of this One Health National Action Plan (NAP) for Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) 2.0. We express our immense gratitude to all those who played a role in providing the nation with a clear, prioritised, costed, and measurable road map to tackling the challenge of antimicrobial resistance.

We  thank  the  former  Director-General,  Dr  Ifedayo  Adetifa,  for  his  leadership  in  the  planning  and development of this AMR NAP 2.0. We recognise the enormous support from our parent ministry, the Federal Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. Special accolades go to Dr Tochi Okwor (NCDC) who ensured effective multisectoral coordination and collaboration throughout the AMR  NAP  2.0 development process as the AMR Coordinating Committee (AMRCC) Chairperson (Representing the Director-General) alongside Co-Chairs Dr Columba Teru Vakuru (Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security) and Mr Olubunmi Olusanya (Federal Ministry of Environment) whose continuous support and cooperation reaffirmed the commitment to Nigeria's effort at containing AMR using the One Health approach. We also acknowledge the contributions of Dr Sikiru Badaru (Director of Planning Research and Statistics, NCDC), Dr Ridwan Yahaya (AMR Lead and his team, NCDC), Dr Mwapu Ndahi (Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security), Mrs Rita Okea (Federal Ministry of Environment), and Pharm James  Yakubu  (Federal  Ministry  of  Health  and  Social  Welfare)  who  worked  tirelessly  to  ensure  the successful production of a new NAP for Nigeria.

We acknowledge the unwavering support from the United Nations Quadripartite agencies, namely the World  Health  Organization  (WHO),  World  Organisation  for  Animal  Health  (WOAH),  Food  and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and we especially appreciate the WHO team including Dr Laxmikant Chavan (WHO Nigeria Country Office), Mr Anand Balachandran  and  Dr  Nienke  Bruinsma  (WHO  Headquarters),  and  Dr  Yahaya  Ali  Ahmed  and  Mr Yidnekachew Mazengiya (WHO African Regional Office) for the technical guidance and major financial support  for  all  the  AMR  NAP  2.0  development  workshops;  Dr  Ayodele  Majekodunmi  of  the  United Nations FAO; Dr Passoret Vounba of WOAH; and Levis Kavagi of UNEP. We are mindful of the immense contributions of our esteemed partners, including Pharm Babatunde Akinola and his team from USAID's Medicines,  Technologies,  and  Pharmaceutical  Services  (MTaPS)  Program  and  Niniola  Williams  who facilitated the entire development process of the AMR NAP 2.0. We appreciate WHO consultants Mr Enos  Omondi  and  Ms  Chanceline  Bilounga  for  the  expertise  and  insight  they  brought  from  other countries alongside Pharm Estelle Mbadiwe, Erta Kalanxhi, and the One Health Trust (OHT) team for their  work  on  the  One  Health  AMR  Situational  Analysis.  We  also  thank  Dr  Solomon  Olorunleke  (Dr Ameyo Stella Adadevoh Health Trust), Dr Zainab Abdulkareem and Mrs Maureen Kajo who provided technical support throughout the process.

We sincerely appreciate all members of the National AMR Coordinating Committee (AMRCC), the Chair of the AMR Technical Working Groups (TWGs) Professor Aaron Aboderin, and the Co-chair Professor Kabir  Junaid  for  their  contribution  to  the  development  of  the  AMR  NAP  2.0.  Finally,  we thank  all members of the academia, associations, national experts, civil society organisations, the private sector, and all other consultants who were engaged and made contributions to make this robust plan a reality.

In summary, the collaborative efforts of visionary leaders, dedicated individuals, expert coordinators, reviewers, and external contributors have collectively shaped a comprehensive and forward-thinking AMR NAP 2.0. Their top-notch commitment and diverse expertise have been pivotal in addressing the threat posed by antimicrobial resistance in Nigeria.

This  has  far-reaching  effects  on  the  health  of  populations  and economies.

Nigeria is  number 19 of 204 countries with the highest age-standardised mortality rate per 100,000 population associated with AMR. 1  In 2019, there were 64,500 deaths attributable to AMR and 263,400 deaths associated with AMR, making the number of AMR deaths in Nigeria higher than those from enteric infections, respiratory infections and tuberculosis, maternal and neonatal disorders, neglected tropical diseases and malaria, and cardiovascular diseases. 1  However, this is likely underestimated considering the  gaps  that  exist  in  national  AMR  surveillance.  In  addition  to  the  impact  on  mortality,  loss  of  gross domestic product (GDP) attributable to AMR in developing countries like Nigeria has been forecast to reach 5 - 7% by 2050. 2

The  AMR  NAP  2.0  is  focused  on  ensuring  that    successful interventions continue while prioritising new evidence-based solutions. The plan consists of 6 strategic objectives with 40 strategic intervention areas, 143 activities and 451 sub-activities with costing and a monitoring and evaluation framework.

To support the resource mobilisation efforts towards the realisation  of  this  plan,  short-term  prioritised  plans  will  be  developed  at  intervals  to  direct  funding opportunities to the priority interventions that can drive immediate impact.

Through  intense  collaboration,  education,  and  innovation  this  AMR  NAP  2.0  fosters  a  One  Health approach that can effectively address the evolving challenges posed by AMR across the country.

## The National Action Plan (NAP) 2.0 Development Process

The development of this Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) National Action Plan (NAP) 2.0 used a One Health approach, integrating efforts across the human, animal, and environmental health domains.

Nigeria used a collaborative development process as shown in Figure 1 for the AMR NAP 2.0, which began with a review of the AMR NAP 1.0 and ended with the successful launch of the AMR NAP 2.0. Throughout the process, which was driven by the AMR Coordinating Committee (AMRCC), national stakeholders, domestic partners, and quadripartite UN partners and experts were engaged and involved to ensure an inclusive and thorough process.

## Review of AMR NAP 1.0: Building Foundations for Progress

The  journey  towards the  AMR  NAP  2.0 commenced  in  July  2022  with  a  critical  evaluation  of  the implementation of the prior plan, AMR NAP 1.0. To ensure a thorough assessment a consultant was engaged to assess the country's progress in implementing the AMR NAP 1.0 and a convergent parallel mixed methods approach was used for the review. This methodological framework encompassed a desk review,  survey,  and  interviews  with  key  informants  from  the  tripartite  surveys  and  other  sectors involved. Data collection tools were developed, validated, and used to assess policy documents, progress reports,  updates,  and  minutes,  as  well  as  reports  from  the  AMR  National  Technical  Working  Group (AMR-NTWG) and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) database.

The  consultant's  investigations  included  five face-to-face  and  in-depth  virtual interviews with stakeholders,  ensuring  a  comprehensive  understanding  of  diverse  perspectives.  To  support  the evaluation,  internal  and  external  reports  such  as  the  Joint  External  Evaluation  (JEE),  Tripartite  AMR

Country Self-Assessment Surveys (TrACSS), Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS) evaluation report, FAO's Progressive Management Pathway (PMP) report, and NAP Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) were collated and reviewed. The culmination of these efforts resulted in the AMR NAP 1.0 Review Report, which  was  disseminated  to  the  AMR  Coordination  Committee  (AMRCC),  NTWG,  and  the  relevant sectors.

## Constitution of a One Health Subcommittee: Synergising Efforts

In August 2022, recognising the complexity of the task at hand, a One Health AMR subcommittee was established to lead the development  of AMR  NAP  2.0.  This  collaborative venture included representatives from the Quadripartite (FAO, WHO, WOAH, and UNEP) and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. A workplan for the AMR NAP 2.0 process was developed in November 2022, providing a road map for subsequent activities.

## Engagement with One Health Trust (OHT): Technical Expertise Amplified

In March 2023, a strategic alliance was formed between Nigeria's AMRCC and the One Health Trust (OHT), a World Health Organization (WHO) coordinating centre, facilitated through the WHO Geneva and Nigeria country offices. This partnership aimed to leverage technical expertise for the development of Nigeria's comprehensive One Health AMR Situational Analysis. To facilitate seamless collaboration, a data sharing memorandum of understanding (MOU) was drafted and endorsed by the collaborating One Health sectors.

The methodology employed involved sharing documents already in the public domain with the OHT to kick-start the analytical process. More than 40 key informant interviews were conducted virtually on thematic and strategic pillars of the AMR response and weekly progress review meetings continued from March 2023, ensuring a constant flow of information from stakeholders across the three sectors and regular updates, fostering a dynamic and iterative process.

## Recruitment of Consultants: Expertise Amplified for In-Depth Analysis

To  bolster  the  depth  and  breadth  of  the  AMR  NAP  2.0 development,  various  entities  engaged consultants with specialised expertise. USAID/MTaPS enlisted the support of a consultant to lead the process  of  developing  the  AMR  NAP  2.0,  while  WHO  and  FAO  engaged  consultants  to  conduct systematic  reviews  of  AMR  and  antimicrobial  usage  in  the  human  health  sector  and  the  food  and agricultural  system,  respectively.  Simultaneously,  in-country  consultants  collaborated  with  relevant sectors, sourcing additional information and documents vital for a comprehensive understanding. The findings  from  these  reviews  were  incorporated  into  the  One  Health  Situational Analysis,  ensuring  a synthesis  of  both  global  and  local  perspectives.  The  draft  Situational  Analysis  underwent  rigorous scrutiny by the AMRCC members and other key stakeholders, enriching the comprehensive foundation laid for the development of the AMR NAP 2.0.

## AMR Leadership and Multisectoral Collaboration Training: Strengthening Capacities

In  March  2023,  the  WHO Nigeria  Country  Office,  WHO  Regional  Office  for  Africa,  and  WHO Headquarters, in collaboration with the AMRCC, organised a crucial capacity-building initiative with the aim of equipping representatives from the three One Health sectors, the Quadripartite, and consultants with essential leadership skills requisite for the NAP development process. Recognising the importance of  leadership  in  navigating  the  AMR  response,  this  capacity-building  initiative  fostered  a  holistic understanding of AMR and promoted effective collaboration among diverse stakeholders. Overall, 39 participants  from  13  agencies  actively  participated  and  aligned  on  the  AMR  NAP  2.0 development process as a common goal and mission for Nigeria.

## Road Map for NAP Development: Charting the Course for Success

To produce the AMR NAP 2.0, five development workshops were held to focus on various aspects of the  NAP. These  were  Stakeholder  Mapping;  One  Health  Situational  Analysis  and  SWOT  Analysis; Strategic Plan and Operational Plan; Monitoring and Evaluation; and Budgeting and Costing. The full list of participants and group photographs from each workshop are included in Annex 2.

In  August  2023,  the  first  of  four  AMR  NAP  2.0 development workshops was  conducted.  This  first workshop  focused  on  Stakeholder  Mapping  to  gain  a  collective  understanding  of  the  diverse stakeholders required to participate and contribute to the AMR NAP 2.0 development process and its

implementation.  The  42 stakeholders  who  participated  included 28  representatives  of  ministries, agencies, and departments; 5 partner organisations; and 9 representatives of private groups. Among this group were 25 human health experts, 13 animal health experts, and 4 environmental health experts to ensure the approach was inclusive.

The second workshop was held in September 2023 and focused on the draft One Health Situational Analysis, which was shared with 59 stakeholders for their feedback. During this workshop, a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis was conducted, laying the groundwork for the development  of  the  strategic  and  operational  plan  sections  of  the  AMR  NAP  2.0.  Also,  as the recommendations from the AMR NAP 1.0 Review and the Situational Analysis were available, there was a  need  to  harmonise  and prioritise  all  the  recommendations.  This  was  done  through  multisectoral stakeholder engagement in breakout groups during this second workshop, where a larger number of 24 ministries, agencies, and departments were represented by 44 people, alongside 7 partner agencies and 4 private groups. The human health sector was represented by 32 people, the animal health sector by 19 people and the environmental health sector by 8 people.

To maximise stakeholder engagement, the third and fourth workshops were combined. Thus, the third workshop addressed both the Strategic Plan and Operational Plan as well as Monitoring and Evaluation. The focus of the fourth and final workshop was Budgeting and Costing of the AMR NAP 2.0, and these final two workshops spanned from October to November 2023. A total of 64 people attended the third workshop, making it the largest of all four with strong representation from all three sectors as well as participation  from  cross-cutting  ministries  such  as  the  Federal  Ministry  of  Finance  and  the  Federal Ministry of Water Resources. The fourth and final workshop had in attendance a total of 37 people representing 10 organisations across the One Health sectors.

Output of the Stakeholder Mapping Workshop : Validated stakeholder mapping including stakeholders to  engage  in  the  AMR  NAP  2.0 development  process  and  implementation;  launch  of  the  AMR stakeholder's database tool. In all, 145 stakeholder groups were identified and mapped against their levels of interest and influence, their proposed participation in the NAP development process, and the strategic objective areas they align with.

Output of One Health AMR Situational Analysis and SWOT Workshop :  Structured feedback on the Situational  Analysis;  validated  SWOT  analysis  for  all  NAP  strategic  areas;  prioritised  AMR  NAP  2.0 recommendations for all NAP strategic areas; identified barriers, solutions, and next steps. Collectively, 157  recommendations  were  prioritised  across  all  six  strategic  objective  areas  and  148  solutions  to barriers/next steps towards tackling AMR in Nigeria were identified.

Output of Strategic and Operational Plan Workshop : A well-defined strategic plan including Nigeria's goals, strategic objectives, and priority intervention areas; a draft theory of change for Nigeria's AMR NAP 2.0; an operational plan outlining high-impact interventions, with clear activities, timelines, and responsible parties; a draft monitoring and evaluation framework.

Output of Costing and Budgeting Workshop : Training on the WHO NAP Costing and Budgeting Tool; costed operational plan with indicative budget amounts for all activities and sub-activities.

## Conclusion

The journey towards the One Health AMR National Action Plan 2.0 is a testament to the collaborative spirit, meticulous planning, and dedication of the diverse stakeholders involved. From the critical review of AMR NAP 1.0 to the strategic engagement with consultants, Nigeria's AMR NAP 2.0 development process reflects a commitment to a comprehensive and holistic One Health approach. The collective efforts of the nation's One Health community has resulted in an adaptable strategy that can effectively combat the growing threat of AMR in a coordinated and comprehensive manner.

## Introduction

Antimicrobials are natural, semi-synthetic, and synthetic drug compounds used to treat bacterial, viral, fungal, and other unicellular parasitic infections in human and veterinary medicine. 3 The discovery and introduction  of  antimicrobials  caused  a  fundamental  change  not  only  in  the  treatment  of  infectious diseases but also in the fate of humanity by increasing life expectancy significantly from less than 20 years to 58 years. 4 Similarly, the discovery of antimicrobials revolutionised the management of infections in animals and to some extent crops, hence improving global food security as evidenced by increased yields of animal- and crop-sourced foods. 3

The world is currently grappling with a formidable challenge, known as antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which  threatens  the  effectiveness  of  antimicrobials  and  poses  an  escalating  threat  to  public  health worldwide. 5 Unfortunately, AMR has already taken a considerable toll, with an estimated 1.27 million human fatalities attributed to it in 2019. 6 More disconcerting are projections indicating that by 2050, the annual death toll due to AMR may surge to a staggering 10 million and AMR is expected to cost the world $100 trillion in lost revenue if immediate and concerted global precautionary measures are not taken. 1 With this in mind, it is important to acknowledge that the burden of AMR-related mortality will be disproportionately borne by low- and-middle-income countries (LMICs). 7 These nations, grappling with a higher prevalence of infectious diseases, continue to confront a substantial share of preventable deaths  stemming  from  infectious  diseases. 1 Recent  estimates  show  that  the  western  sub-Saharan African region has the highest AMR burden, with 27.3 deaths attributable to AMR per 100,000 overall deaths. 2 In 2019, the mortality rate due to AMR in Nigeria surpassed that of deaths resulting from enteric infections,  respiratory  infections,  tuberculosis,  maternal  and  neonatal  disorders,  neglected  tropical diseases, malaria, and cardiovascular diseases. 1 Furthermore, the study identified five pathogens, along with  their  associated  AMR-related  deaths: Streptococcus  pneumoniae (54,300), Klebsiella pneumoniae (44,300), Escherichia coli (38,200), Staphylococcus aureus (32,300), and Group B Streptococcus (16,600). These pathogens are frequently implicated in lower respiratory infections, as well as other infections affecting the thorax, meningitis, bacterial central nervous system infections, bloodstream infections, and peritoneal  and  intra-abdominal  infections. 1 Amid the AMR crisis lies the pervasive issue of selective pressure  from  antimicrobial  overuse  and  misuse,  a  phenomenon  intrinsically  intertwined  with  the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. 8

The multifaceted nature of AMR involves a diverse array of interconnected drivers, from shifts in human demographics and the threat of climate change to the complexities of international trade. 3 Furthermore, it is essential to recognise that AMR is not limited to human health alone. 4,9 It affects both animal and environmental  health,  creating  a  triangle  of  interrelated  challenges.  For  example,  the  misuse  of antibiotics in animal husbandry (in feed as growth promoters, prophylaxis, and metaphylaxis), agriculture, and aquaculture contributes to the development of resistant bacteria in terrestrial, aquatic, and wild animals and the environment, creating a reservoir of resistant pathogens that can spill over to humans. 4 The interface of human-animal-environmental health underscores the need for a One Health approach, recognising the inextricable link between these sectors in the context of AMR. 66

Nigeria, being one of Africa's most populous and culturally diverse nations, is confronted with a unique and daunting challenge in its fight against AMR due to its rapidly growing population and wide variety of healthcare and agricultural practices. A full appreciation of the intensity of the burden of AMR in Nigeria may be undermined by the lack of accurate, robust data on phenotypic and genotypic AMR profiles from human and animal health sectors. 10 However, there is no doubt that if left unchecked, AMR will  increase  the  likelihood  that  common  infections  will  become  more  difficult  to  treat,  affecting healthcare costs and livelihoods and jeopardising socioeconomic development. 9,11 Hence the need for the AMR National Action Plan (NAP) 2.0 for Nigeria - a meticulously formulated strategic response

aimed at addressing the multifaceted aspects of AMR within the context of the nation's One Health landscape.

Nigeria's AMR NAP serves as a pivotal instrument in the nation's holistic approach to combatting AMR. It underscores Nigeria's unwavering commitment to curbing AMR in a way that encompasses awareness creation, surveillance, regulation, infection prevention and control including vaccination, stewardship, and the principles of One Health. The overarching goal extends beyond safeguarding the health and well-being of Nigeria's populace to encompass a broader commitment to contribute to the global mission of  combating  AMR  through  a  One  Health  approach,  recognising  the  vital  roles  of  animal  and environmental health in the intricate web of AMR.

Numerous studies conducted in Nigeria have shed light on the dire consequences of infections caused by resistant bacteria. These infections are associated with heightened morbidity, increased mortality rates,  and  elevated  medical  expenses  when  compared  to  those  caused  by  susceptible  strains. 12 An unchecked proliferation of resistant bacteria could potentially usher in a post-antibiotic era, reminiscent of  the  pre-antibiotic  age  characterised  by  high  levels  of  illness  and  death  resulting  from  common infections and minor injuries. 13

The AMR crisis in Nigeria is a longstanding issue with profound implications for the whole of society. The rise of resistant microorganisms has led to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. To tackle this crisis effectively, it is imperative to put all effort towards the successful implementation of this AMR NAP 2.0.

## The One Health AMR Situational Analysis

Nigeria developed her first five-year, One Health National Action Plan on AMR (AMR NAP 1.0) in 2017, in line with the 2015 World Health Assembly recommendation. This plan included well-defined strategic objectives for a coordinated AMR response, involving the human and animal health, environment, and agro-food sectors, and was implemented over five years. As a prerequisite to development of the AMR NAP 2.0, there was a need to develop a One Health AMR Situational Analysis 2.0.

The process of developing Nigeria's One Health AMR Situational Analysis 2.0 was collaborative under the coordination of the AMRCC and guided by a consultant-led approach. It involved stakeholders such as the One Health Trust, FAO, and WHO. This inclusive method integrated a wealth of data from diverse sources,  including  documents,  reports,  and  information  from  ministries,  departments,  and  agencies (MDAs), partners, programmes, and peer-reviewed literature, and consultation with AMR experts in the country to highlight the status of AMR in Nigeria. A systematic review of literature, coupled with key informant  interviews  and  comprehensive  AMR  assessments,  laid  the  groundwork  for  a  thorough understanding of the current landscape of AMR across the country and across sectors. The process also included a collaborative review workshop, where diverse perspectives converged to refine and enhance the proposed strategies, ensuring a robust and well-informed framework.

## Outline of the Situational Analysis

The Situational Analysis comprises key components that collectively paint a vivid picture of the AMR scenario in Nigeria: from a detailed examination of the country profile, which offers insights into the national context, to the existing evidence related to AMR, the ongoing responses and interventions, and the  implementation  status  of  the  National  Action  Plan  1.0. This comprehensive  analysis  aims  to strategically examine AMR and its challenges across the nation.

## Human Health Sector

Misuse of antimicrobials is common in Nigeria, with many studies citing irrational use stemming from high levels of poverty and infectious disease burdens, limited local manufacturing, poor regulation of the quality  of  antibiotics  in  circulation, and  indiscriminate  antibiotic  consumption.  Six  compounds  metronidazole, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, and ciprofloxacin - comprised more than 55% of all antibiotics used in the country, which may contribute to their loss of effectiveness. Only 54% of antibiotics used were in the WHO Access category, which was lower than the recommended threshold of 60%, and this was coupled with overuse of antibiotics from the Watch category (46%). Data available places the national Drug Resistance Index at 65.9%, a percentage that is significantly higher than the threshold of 25% which indicates that AMR is being controlled. 14,15

Antibiotic prescription rates remain high in Nigerian hospitals, with point prevalence survey (PPS) rates of 60-98% in hospitals across the country. 16,17,18 Paediatric wards show similar results with PPS rates of

77-92%. 19,20,21 Prescriptions remain largely empirical, with few backed by microbiological evidence. The most prescribed compounds were third-generation cephalosporins. Poor awareness among healthcare workers, lack of guidelines, and pressure from patients were some risk factors associated with high prescription rates.

Between 2017 and 2022, out of 12,251 samples from the national AMR surveillance network, 5,601 returned bacterial isolates, with high resistance levels of most isolates to most antibiotics tested. The most prevalent resistant profiles were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in 19% of total isolates, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in 19% of total isolates and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in 4% of total isolates. Multidrug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR), and pan-drug-resistant (PDR) isolates of S. aureus, Escherichia coli , and Klebsiella pneumoniae were also found. Retrospective data from 23,963 positive cultures from 25 laboratories between 2016 and 2018 suggest high levels of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (67-73%) and MRSA (58-82%). The same study also reported moderate to high levels of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas  aeruginosa (30-53%),  and  fluoroquinolone-resistant Salmonella species (46-75%). 14

Peer-reviewed research reveals similar trends. The most frequently studied pathogens were E. coli (21 studies, 30.4%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (13 studies, 18.8%), and Staphylococcus aureus (11 studies, 15.9%).  The  studies  assessed  resistance  to  52  antibiotics,  including  gentamicin  (8.8%),  ciprofloxacin (8.0%),  and  ceftazidime  (7.3%).  The  studies  showed  moderate  to  high  levels  of  resistance  to  all antibiotics, including Watch category compounds such as cefotaxime (5-100%), cefixime (18-100%), and meropenem (2-79%), and those in the Reserve category such as ceftazidime and avibactam (59%) and linezolid (5-36%). Of concern are high levels of resistance to Access and Watch category antibiotics and MDR at the community level. Of the 46 studies reviewed, 16 (34.8%) were funded by international organisations, while 30 (65%) received no funding, highlighting the lack of dedicated domestic funding for AMR research in Nigeria. Studies have also reported clarithromycin resistance in Helicobacter pylori (a WHO high priority pathogen) in Nigeria, ranging from 14.4.% in 2017, to 25% in 2020. 22,23

## Animal Health

Key findings  in  animal  health  include  resistance  profiles  of  bacteria  in  food  animals  (notably E.  coli, Salmonella,  Pseudomonas,  Aeromonas,  Staphylococcus spp. ,  Enterococcus,  Campylobacter )  against  more than 50 antimicrobials. High levels of resistance to aminoglycosides (gentamicin), macrolides (erythromycin), cephalosporin, quinolones, and tetracycline were observed. Meta-analysis reveals that 10.9% of bacteria reported were MDR and 2.3% were XDR. The distribution of studies shows a bias towards  poultry  (49%).  Thus,  more  attention  to  other  food  animal  species  (pigs,  ruminants,  fish)  is required.

Poor awareness of AMR and misuse and abuse of antimicrobials are widespread among farmers in animal and crop production, including the use of antimicrobials banned for use in animals, not registered for use

by the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), and critically important antimicrobials for human health. Eleven classes of antimicrobials were imported for animal use in Nigeria between 2014 and 2017. The  most  frequently  imported  classes  of  antimicrobial  agents  were  tetracyclines  (629,236 kg), polypeptides (148,974 kg), and macrolides (132,712 kg). 24

## Environmental Health

Environmental data is only available from research. High levels of Enterobacteriaceae caused by faecal contamination of soil, water, and effluents point to the environment as a major contributor to AMR due to open defecation and poor WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene). Bacteria of clinical relevance, such as Aeromonas,  Streptococcus,  Staphylococcus,  Bacillus  subtilis, and Vibrio , showed  resistance  to  106 antibiotics representing 19 different classes of antimicrobials. High levels of resistance were observed to aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, and amphenicols. 25,26

Bacterial  tolerance  to  heavy  metals  (copper,  lead,  cadmium,  zinc,  chromium,  silver,  and  nickel)  at concentrations above the maximum recommended limits has been reported in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus, Bacillus, Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio, Citrobacter, E. coli, Pseudomonas , and Klebsiella . 27,28,29

Resistance to commonly used disinfectants has also been recorded in bacteria of clinical relevance such as S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus spp ., Klebsiella, E. coli . 30,31 These bacteria showed varying levels of resistance to disinfectants commonly used in hospitals, farms, and food-processing environments such as saponated cresols, chloroxylenol, sodium hypochlorite, and chlorhexidine. One study reported the detection of disinfectant resistance genes qac E and sit ABCD in XDR E. coli strains isolated  from  chickens. 32 These  genes  are  known  to  confer  resistance  to  quaternary  ammonium compounds and hydrogen peroxides respectively. It is therefore recommended to routinely monitor resistance to commonly used disinfectants.

## Plant Health

The increased demand for food and other agricultural produce, due to exponential population growth, have placed a heavy burden on the use of  agrochemicals. These pesticides,  some  of which  contain antimicrobials, play a pivotal role in reducing losses due to bacteria, fungi, viruses, insects, and rodents. 33 Although the quantity of  antimicrobials  used  in  crops  is  considerably  less than  the  amount  used  in livestock, 34 the potential hazards associated with antimicrobial resistance should not be ignored. The residues of antimicrobial pesticides (fungicides and antibiotics) in crops can influence the evolution of resistant strains of bacteria and fungi in the environment and ultimately impede exportation of crops with residues above the maximum residue limits (MRL). 35

Nigeria  is  one  of  the  largest  importers  of  pesticides  in  Africa,  with  insecticides,  fungicides,  and rodenticides as the three most used categories in crop value chains. Antimicrobials approved for use in the control of bacterial diseases of plants include oxytetracycline, streptomycin, gentamicin,

kasugamycin, and oxolinic acid. Oxytetracycline and streptomycin are the most widely used. 36| These have potential to pose public health and environmental challenges due to their high usage.

Up to half of the pesticides used in Nigeria are highly hazardous compounds banned for use in other parts of the world. 37 Pesticide-associated poisonings from food consumption are a regular occurrence, but morbidity and mortality are not systematically reported. 37 After a review and reclassification exercise in 2023, NAFDAC's Green Book product database lists 30 banned pesticides, only three of which are antimicrobial pesticides (fungicides) -captafol (tetrahydrophthalimide,  toluene, and  chlorinated substances), binapacryl (ester derivative of dinoseb) and hexachlorobenzene (chlorinated hydrocarbon). Unfortunately, weak regulation and porous borders mean that even banned pesticides still find their way into the country. As a consequence of this, Nigeria records losses of up to 362.5 million USD annually as it is unable to export beans, fish, and honey among other agricultural products to the EU market. 38 For example, beans were banned in 2015 because of dichlorvos pesticide residue of 0.3-4.6 mg/kg, exceeding  the  maximum  acceptable  residue  limit  of  0.01 mg/kg.  Unfortunately,  most  studies  on pesticide safety and residue limits have focused on the herbicidal and insecticidal compounds, with no investigation of their antimicrobial activity. These agricultural pesticides persist in the environment and bioaccumulate in the tissues of plants and animals, contaminating foods and the environment. 39,40,41,42 Apart from antimicrobial use for plant health within Nigeria, there is also a risk of antimicrobial residues in imported foods.

## Situational Analysis Outcome

The result of the Situational Analysis was a comprehensive review of AMR in the country and a road map for addressing AMR, with clear recommendations for each strategic objective area.

The Situational Analysis 2.0 not only identified critical areas for intervention as outlined below in Table 1, but also laid the foundation for a coordinated, evidence-driven strategy in the ongoing battle against AMR in Nigeria.

## AMR Governance Framework

To  support  the  fight  against  AMR  in  Nigeria,  the  nation  has  established  a  strong,  multisectoral governance  structure  that  demonstrates  a  One  Health  approach  to  addressing AMR activities.  This structure  which  showcases  the  commitment  of  the  Federal  Government  to  ensuring  effective communication, collaboration, and coordination among sectors - provides a comprehensive model for operationalising interventions that prevent and reduce AMR in Nigeria.

The One Health AMR Governance Framework, illustrated in Figure 4, includes the following entities:

-  The National One Health Steering Committee (NOHSC) :  As the overall decision-making and policy-setting body for AMR in Nigeria, the NOHSC oversees the National One Health Technical Committee (NOHTC) and the Antimicrobial Resistance Coordinating Committee (AMRCC) listed below. It is comprised of the Coordinating Minister of Health and Social Welfare, Minister of Agriculture and Food Security, Minister of Environment, Minister of Finance, and Minister of Information.
-  The Antimicrobial Resistance Coordinating Committee (AMRCC) : The AMRCC provides direct leadership and coordination of interventions from the multisectoral technical working groups. It is  comprised  of  focal  points  from  the  Federal  Ministry  of  Health,  the  Federal  Ministry  of Agriculture  and  Food  Security,  the  Federal  Ministry  of  Environment, and  the  chairs  of  the National AMR TWG.
-  The National AMR Technical Working Group (NTWG) : The NTWG is comprised of five subTWGs with a focus on awareness/education, surveillance, stewardship, infection prevention and control (including vaccination), and research. These TWGs have mixed membership including experts from ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs), academia, civil societies, regulatory bodies, and research institutions.

The complete governance structure, roles and responsibilities, and standards of operation are available in the 2019 One Health Governance Manual .

## Strategic Plan

## Mission

To  use  a  whole-of-society,  One  Health  approach  to  safeguard  the  prudent  use  of  antimicrobial medicines, and to strengthen evidence-based policy making and action to protect health.

## Vision

A healthy nation where AMR prevention and response is prompt and evidence based.

## Goal

To reduce, prevent, and slow the evolution of resistant organisms and their impact on humans, animals, and  the  ecosystem  while  ensuring  optimal  use  and  improved  access  to  effective,  safe, and  qualityassured antimicrobials and diagnostics for continued successful management of infections.

## Guiding Principles

These eight guiding principles underpin the foundation of this AMR NAP 2.0 and its implementation.

- 1. One Health approach and inclusive governance
- 2. Private sector collaboration
- 3. Community engagement
- 4. Ensuring access while avoiding excess
- 5. Prevention first
- 6. Evidence-based decision making
- 7. Sustainable interventions
- 8. Incremental targets for implementation

## Strategic Objectives

Nigeria has outlined the following six strategic objectives which must be operationalised to achieve our goal and vision for AMR.

These  objectives  focus  on  ensuring  that  there  are  strong  governance  structures  to  drive  the  AMR response at the national and subnational levels, improving understanding of AMR to drive behaviour change, strengthening the nation's AMR evidence base through surveillance and research, preventing and controlling infections, ensuring optimal use of antimicrobials across the One Health sectors, and fostering development of therapeutics and diagnostics.

Although each strategic objective has its own specific intervention areas, activities, and sub-activities which are listed in the Operational Plan section, they have been developed as a set of actions that will have the greatest impact when implemented together.

## Strategic Objective 1: Strengthen leadership, collaboration, coordination, and AMR governance structures at national and subnational levels

To effectively address AMR in Nigeria, a robust governance structure within the One Health framework is essential as strong, coordinated commitment is a requirement for the success of this AMR NAP 2.0.

The complex challenge of AMR demands domestic governance mechanisms which enable all required stakeholders to collaborate towards a collective impact in Nigeria's AMR response, while ensuring the response  is  in  line  with  other  national  policies  and  plans.  This  includes  consistent  intersectoral collaboration mechanisms, national and subnational structures that reflect the One Health approach, and integration of AMR into other national plans and strategies.

Furthermore, to drive the AMR governance structure at the national and subnational levels, political will is paramount, especially in implementing regulatory measures. Clear leadership, streamlined roles and responsibilities, and data sharing to ensure the funding, resources, and monitoring required to achieve the goal of AMR NAP 2.0 will be put in place at the national and subnational levels.

## Strategic Objective 2: Improve antimicrobial resistance (AMR) awareness, education, understanding, and behaviour change among all relevant stakeholders

Tackling AMR in Nigeria demands a holistic approach towards collective responsibility and behavioural change. To communicate the risks of AMR and the proper use of antimicrobials, targeted, standardised, and evidence-based behaviour change communications must reach the public, patients, and producers. Also, targeted communication materials should be disseminated to policy makers at both national and subnational levels while baseline surveillance data should be widely shared, with campaigns extending to farmers, feed millers, and drug vendors, emphasising responsible antibiotic use and alternatives.

Education  plays  a  pivotal  role,  from  integrating  AMR  into  continuing  professional  education  to embedding  it  in  secondary  school  curricula.  This  ensures  a  gradual  understanding  of  the  issue  as individuals progress through their careers in the One Health sectors or beyond.

Awareness research initiatives should focus on multisectoral stakeholder mapping and routine studies to comprehend the knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions of the public on AMR. In particular, policy development requires repeating awareness assessments, comparing results, and incorporating outcomes  into  future  campaigns,  fostering  a  continuous  and  adaptive  approach  to  combat  AMR effectively.

## Strategic Objective 3: Improve evidence base through strengthening One Health AMR surveillance systems and operational research for decision making

Accurate and timely data on antimicrobial use and resistance are imperative for shaping AMR policies, programmes, and decisions in Nigeria. This data must be comprehensive, reliable, and representative of the  entire  country,  enabling  close  monitoring  of  the  impact  of  emerging  infections,  identification  of disproportionately  affected  population  groups,  and  informed  decision making  for  prevention  and containment measures. Strengthening laboratory capacities across One Health sectors, including private sector involvement, is essential for a holistic approach to data collection.

National policies, developed within legal and ethical frameworks, should ensure uniform data collection and quality control through established guidelines and standard operating procedures (SOPs), drawing on  methodologies  such  as the  Tricycle  Project  and  WHO  GLASS.  Further,  integrating  AMR-related indicators into existing surveillance systems fosters collaboration among diverse stakeholders, including government health departments, veterinary services, pharmaceutical industries, academic institutions, and international organisations. Comprehensive country mapping of AMR surveillance, spanning clinical cases, environment, food, plants, and animals, is foundational.

Capacity  building  for  surveillance  is  also  integral,  addressing  geographical  disparities  and  involving private  laboratories.  Resource  allocation,  region-specific  training  programmes,  and  investment  in laboratory capacity based on identified needs in each geopolitical zone will contribute to the success of surveillance efforts.

## Strategic Objective 4: Improve implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC) programmes, biosecurity, and vaccination uptake including access to WASH across the One Health sectors

Prioritising the reduction of infections and curbing the spread of resistant microbes is crucial in the fight against AMR. From farms to communities and healthcare facilities, consistent application of hygiene, vaccination, and infection prevention measures is essential to mitigate the impact of AMR. Ensuring improved  access  to  clean  water,  adequate  sanitation,  proper  waste  management,  and  increased vaccination uptake are vital aspects to prevent the transmission of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.

In  healthcare  settings,  particularly  amid  emerging  threats  and  outbreaks,  infection  prevention  and control (IPC) plays a pivotal role. Comprehensive strategies are required to enhance biosecurity and IPC measures, encompassing key recommendations such as advocacy, infrastructure improvement, policy adherence, financial resource alignment, awareness training, and effective governance.

Advocacy serves a central role in reinforcing biosecurity and IPC measures. Regular, high-quality training for healthcare workers and farmers on best practices is essential, and private sector as well as informal sector involvement in programme design and execution brings valuable perspectives and resources. A holistic  approach  emphasising  basic  measures  such  as hygiene,  sanitation,  waste  management,  and

personal protective equipment is crucial. Advocating for these measures at all levels is imperative for reducing hazards and risks.

## Strategic Objective 5: Improve access to quality antimicrobials and optimise their use across One Health sectors

The inappropriate use and abuse of antimicrobials poses a significant threat to public health, driving the spread and dissemination of AMR. To combat this, a comprehensive strategy is imperative, involving prescribers, producers, and patients in safeguarding the effectiveness of antimicrobials. This requires the provision of knowledge, guidelines, and tools for proper antimicrobial use in both humans and animals. Key  measures  include  improved  drug  labelling,  stringent  enforcement  of  prescription  policies, distribution, regulations, and comprehensive data collection on consumption. Additionally, efforts to reduce  the  importation  of  substandard  and  falsified  drugs  contribute  to  ensuring  the  availability  of quality antimicrobials.

In human health, the development of an antimicrobial use/stewardship policy is crucial, integrating the AwaRe  classification  into national standard  treatment  guidelines  and  establishing  antimicrobial stewardship committees nationwide. Similar initiatives are essential in veterinary practice, emphasising the creation of stewardship committees and ensuring extensive vaccination coverage for animals.

Regulatory enhancements are pivotal, focusing on strengthened pathways for antibiotic registration, procurement, and distribution. Strict regulations against drug hawking, rigorous enforcement of drug labelling,  and  the  prohibition  of  antibiotics  as  growth  promoters  in  animals  are  indispensable  for controlling  AMR.  Political  commitment  is  crucial  for  relocating  players  in  the  open  drug  market  to coordinated wholesale centres and instituting a compensation programme for adherence to withdrawal periods in the animal sector.

Strengthening procurement and supply chains in both human and animal health sectors ensures the availability of  quality  antimicrobials.  The  inclusion  of  antimicrobial  stewardship  programmes as accreditation criteria for hospitals and the implementation of evidence-based programmes in primary healthcare and ambulatory settings are vital steps.

## Strategic Objective 6: Build knowledge and capacity of relevant stakeholders to improve local innovations, research and development in antimicrobials, diagnostics, and vaccines

Given  the  complexity  and  rapid  progression  of  AMR,  significant  progress  relies  on  innovation  and research into new products, interventions, and methods. Strengthening local research and providing platforms for stakeholder training and knowledge exchange are vital approaches to fostering innovation for AMR.

For example, an annual AMR research fair could serve as a catalyst to enhance research awareness, training, and education, providing scholars nationwide with a platform to present findings and innovative solutions.  Conducting  Knowledge,  Attitude,  and  Practice  surveys  becomes  crucial  for  identifying

knowledge gaps and training needs among stakeholders, ensuring the reproducibility and validation of scientific  results.  Within  the  policy,  guidelines,  and  financial  resources  domain,  it  is  imperative  to integrate AMR/AMU funding into the National Research Agenda priority areas. This integration should involve developing an operational plan with a detailed budget, outlining activities, responsibilities, and funding sources. Collaborative coordination among research institutes, the National Health Research Council, and other relevant bodies can identify and prioritise research areas, emphasising the One Health approach.

The strategic development of antimicrobial alternatives should be pursued through research agendas. Prioritising vaccine research for infectious diseases in animals, along with exploring alternatives such as water treatment, pre- and probiotics, and effective vaccination, aligns with the One Health perspective. Implementing  a  governance  mechanism  for  strategic  and  operational  planning  can  facilitate  the realisation of research agendas.

## Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis

Each strategic objective area has its own strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT). During the second AMR NAP 2.0 development workshop, One Health stakeholders worked together in groups to analyse the SWOT for each strategic area. The output from that workshop is presented below.

## Operational Plan

<!-- image -->

Nigeria's AMR National Action Plan 2.0 provides a coordinated set of activities and actions that must  be implemented to achieve the goal to reduce, prevent, and slow the  evolution  of  resistant  organisms  and  their  impact  on humans, animals, and the ecosystem.

These activities cut across the six strategic objectives, and the AMR  NAP  2.0 Operational Plan includes the strategic intervention area, quantity, lead implementer, timeframe, and cost for each activity and sub-activity. In total, across the six strategic objectives there are 40 strategic intervention areas, 143 activities, and 451 sub-activities which are all costed.

## Monitoring and Evaluation Framework

To track progress of the implementation of the AMR NAP 2.0 and to assess whether it leads to the intended results, a monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) framework is needed to monitor inputs, process, and outputs, as well as to measure outcomes and impacts.

The M&amp;E framework presented here is an embodiment of Nigeria's dedication not just to initiate actions against  AMR  but  to  consistently  measure,  assess,  and  enhance  these  actions.  An  effective  M&amp;E framework is crucial to ensure that our efforts align with our strategic objectives, leading to tangible outcomes in the battle against AMR.

## This framework will:

-  establish clear benchmarks that delineate success in endeavours against AMR;
-  provide a road map for stakeholders at all levels to understand their roles, responsibilities, and the expectations placed upon them;
-  foster  an  environment of transparency and accountability, where efforts can be scrutinised, evaluated, and refined; and
-  encourage a culture of continuous learning, where data-driven insights guide future strategies.

The  framework  was  established  in  consultation  and  collaboration  with  national  and  international partners and experts, based on their experience and skills across a variety of sectors, and is intended to facilitate understanding of how and why the AMR NAP 2.0 is being implemented. Hence, it comprises two sets of M&amp;E activities.

- 1. Monitoring the process and outputs : This focuses on the NAP's inputs, activities, and outputs and is intended to analyse how to improve the collective response by monitoring the progress of the various stakeholders in its implementation.
- 2. Evaluating outcomes and goals : This focuses on the outcomes and impact objectives of the NAP and  is  designed  to  examine  the  efficacy  of  NAP  implementation  initiatives,  monitor  their outcomes, and evaluate their influence on, for instance, AMR patterns, appropriate use, and disease burden in the country.

The M&amp;E framework is supported by indicators that describe what to measure, when to measure it, and how to measure it. These metrics were created to represent the complexity of evaluating AMR across the numerous sectors and the realities of varying national settings and surveillance capacities. The core indicators were selected because they:

-  reflect  an  important  aspect  of  the  AMR  response  that  will  yield  significant  and  meaningful information for managing AMR in Nigeria;

-  are sensitive to change; and
-  are  measurable  within  five  years  (although  measurement  systems  may  require  substantial investment and development in many cases, particularly in non-human sectors).

## Evaluation of AMR NAP 2.0

Effective implementation of the AMR NAP 2.0 will contribute to achieving the AMR prevention and containment goal of ensuring, for as long as possible, continuity of successful treatment and prevention of infectious diseases with effective and safe medicines that are quality-assured, used responsibly, and accessible to all who need them.

Midway through and at the end of the AMR NAP 2.0 period, respectively, there will be a mid-term assessment and an end-term evaluation of its implementation. The former will inform the design of future strategic actions and should engage a wide range of stakeholders and partners, while the latter will guide any revisions that may be required. Both quantitative and qualitative methodologies will be used for evaluation, with an emphasis on:

-  analysis of the implementation of the activities;
-  budgets and finances;
-  systematic study of the data from the outputs and outcomes; and
-  analysis of the strengths, shortcomings, and opportunities in the context of current policies and strategies.

While the end-term evaluation will be carried out externally, the mid-term review will be carried out internally by a joint team of the One Health Ministries, key partners, and stakeholders. The relevance, responsiveness, efficiency, and efficacy of AMR NAP 2.0 implementation, as well as sustainability after termination, should be examined by the evaluators.

## M&amp;E Indicators

The  following  indicators  (Table  2)  will  be  monitored, with  appropriate  disaggregation  in  terms  of implementation by state, community, gender, and vulnerable groups.

## Budget and Costing of AMR NAP 2.0

The successful execution of Nigeria's AMR NAP 2.0 will rely heavily on the availability of sufficient and sustainable resources - human, infrastructural, and financial. The AMR NAP 2.0 was costed using the WHO Costing and Budgeting Tool for AMR National Action Plans. All sub-activities were costed across the six strategic objectives and lead agencies/implementers.

In  total,  the  indicative  cost  to  implement  Nigeria's  five-year  AMR  NAP  2.0 operational  plan  is ₦62,262,379,066.00  (USD  77,633,889.00).  The  comprehensive  budget  includes  specific  unit  costs, funding  sources,  projected  funding  timelines,  and  underlying  assumptions.  The  detailed  costing breakdown for each strategic objective is included in Annex 1.

In  order  to  realise  this  indicative  budget,  Nigeria  must  leverage  both  domestic  and  international resources  including  the  public  and  private  sectors.  Innovative  funding  mechanisms  such  as  publicprivate partnerships, grants, and international collaborations must be explored while also establishing partnerships to secure essential resources for AMR interventions.

These resource mobilisation efforts must begin with the development of a short-term, prioritised plan that can be used to direct funding opportunities to the priority interventions that can drive immediate impact.
