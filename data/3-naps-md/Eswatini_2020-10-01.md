## FOREWORD

Globally   antimicrobial   resistance   (AMR) the ability of pathogenic microbes to develop resistance to the effects of an antimicrobial medication -is on the rise worsened with the minimal development of new antimicrobial agents by pharmaceutical  companies. Irrational use of antimicrobials medicines in human and improper disposal of residues have contributed to the emergence of AMR. The Government of Eswatini (GOE) considers AMR containment a priority; with a national goal to contain AMR by developing an implementation plan for the National AMR Containment Strategic Plan through multi-sectoral collaboration.

The implementation plan details   how antimicrobial resistance (AMR) will be  prevented, monitored, and contained using a One Health Approach across the Ministry of Health (MOH) Ministry of Agriculture (MOA); Ministry of Natural Resources and Energy (MONRE) and other stakeholders in Eswatini. This document outlines the activities that will be conducted to implement the strategic objectives of the National   Antimicrobial Resistance Containment Strategic Plan 2018 2022; with an extension of activities to 2025.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites change over time and no longer respond to antimicrobial medicines; making infections harder to treat, and increasing  the  risk  of  disease  spread,  severe  illness,  and  death.  Due  to  the  increased  global concern on AMR, the World Health Assembly (WHA) called upon member states to develop national action plans (NAPs) to contain AMR. A holistic and multisectoral (One Health) approach is needed to contain the increasing threat of AMR because antimicrobials used to treat various infectious  diseases  in  animals  may  be  the  same  or  be  like  those  used  in  humans.  Resistant bacteria arising either in humans, animals or the environment may spread from one to the other, and from one country to another.

To  curb  and  contain  AMR,  the  Government  of  Eswatini  appointed  an  AMR  Containment Committee (AMRCC) with members from the Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry of Agriculture (MOA),  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  and  Energy  (MONRE),  FAO  and  WHO  country office representatives in  2016 .    The AMRCC then developed a National AMR containment strategic plan 2018-2022 as a foundation for activities to curb and contain AMR.

This document, the implementation plan of the national AMR containment strategic plan 20182022, outlines the plan to implement the strategic objectives, activities, and monitoring and evaluating progress of activities. This implementation plan is to be executed for the period of October 2020 to September 2025 and takes into consideration the following:

- · Translating the strategic objectives to activities and actions.
- · Aligning the implementation plan with existing policies, regulations, and guidelines, and identifying opportunities for improvement.
- · Facilitating national coordination of the implementation of AMR surveillance strategies in the different sectors.
- · Monitoring  the  implementation  plan  outputs  and  collating  experiences  for  future adjustments.

The implementation plan will be operationalized by the technical departments in the respective Ministries with support of implementing partners on key areas, and support from other AMR stakeholders locally and internationally.

Under this implementation plan, five strategic objectives will be implemented:

Strategic  Objective 1 -: Improve  awareness  and  understanding  of  AMR  through  effective communication, education, and training: The awareness of stakeholders on AMR including healthcare professionals, the public, various institutions, schools, and the community will be raised through different communication means, education, community mobilization and health

promotion in respective ministries to ensure that up-to-date information on global and country AMR status is disseminated nationwide.

Strategic  Objective-2  Strengthen  the  knowledge  and  evidence  base  for  AMR  containment through surveillance and research: A functional surveillance system particularly in the human and animal health sectors will be established to monitor and inform policy decision making on slowing  the  spread  of  AMR.  Accurate  and  timely  data  on  patterns  of  antimicrobial  use  and resistance  will  be  generated  to  guide  local  treatment  protocols.  Antimicrobial  use  (AMU), antimicrobial consumption (AMC) and AMR data will be used to guide on areas of research that need to be strengthened to promote appropriate use of antimicrobial agents. The AMR data will also be used to inform and improve programming in the country and reporting to the global antimicrobial resistance surveillance system (GLASS).

Strategic  Objective-3 : Reduce the  incidence  of  infection  across  human,  environment,  and animal  communities  and  healthcare  through  individual  and  environmental  sanitation, hygiene, and infection prevention measures: Infection prevention and control (IPC) practices will  be  re-enforced  to  improve  personal  and  environmental  hygiene  coupled  with  the  IPC measures in both human and animal health sectors to stop the chain of infection, reducing the spread of infections in humans and animals, in food establishments,  and in the community.

Strategic  Objective-4 : Optimize  the  use  of  antimicrobial  medicines  in  human  and  animal health through AMR stewardship: Activities will be implemented that promote the optimal use of  antimicrobial  medicines  in  both  human  and  animal  health  sectors  through  an  improved regulatory framework for antimicrobials, availability and use of guidelines, improved prescribing practices  by  clinicians  and  veterinary  practitioners,  and  sound  use  of  antimicrobials  by consumers and farmers.

Strategic  Objective-5 : Enhance  leadership,  governance,  coordination,  and  investment  in containing  AMR: The  AMRCC  will  be  strengthened  to  high  level  government  coordination across the multi-sector ministries including health, agriculture, and Ministry of Natural resources and Energy. The coordination, monitoring and evaluation of the implementation plan will be conducted by the AMRCC according to their defined terms of reference, supported by a One Health Committee (OHC). The AMRCC will spearhead a close collaboration with the country representatives of WHO and FAO, and regional organizations such as OIE, African Union, Africa CDC, SADC and ASLM.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is the ability of pathogenic microbes to develop resistance to the effects  of  antimicrobial  medication.  Antimicrobial  resistance  develops  over  time,  but  is accelerated by inappropriate use of antimicrobial medicine, lack of access to health services, and through antimicrobial residues in soil, crops, and water. Antimicrobial resistant microbes are found in people, animals, food, and the environment (in water, soil, and air). They can spread between people and animals, including from food of animal origin, and from person to person. Poor  infection control, inadequate  sanitary  conditions  and  inappropriate  food-handling encourage the spread of antimicrobial resistance. New resistance mechanisms are emerging and  spreading  globally,  threatening  our  ability  to  treat  common  infectious  diseases  such  as pneumonia, tuberculosis, blood poisoning, gonorrhea, and foodborne diseases with antimicrobial agents.

Antimicrobial  resistance  has  been  recognized  as  a  threat  to  the  gains  made  in  health  and development and to the attainment of sustainable development goals (SDG) in health security, poverty, economic growth, and food security. For example, emerging resistance to HIV, TB and malaria is an obstacle to the achievement of SDG target 3.3 . At the same time, actions required 1 to achieve SDGs may also have deleterious effects on AMR e.g., the estimated 70% increase in the use of antimicrobials required to double food/animal production between 2010 and 2030 to achieve food security (SDG 2) 1 .

Globally, there is an urgent need to change the antimicrobial prescription and use practices. In recognition  of  this  need,  the  World  Health  Assembly  adopted  the  Global  Action  Plan  on Antimicrobial Resistance in May 2015 and called upon member states to develop national action plans (NAPs) to contain AMR. Accordingly, the Government of Eswatini appointed the AMR Containment Committee (AMRCC) with members from the Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry of  Agriculture  (MOA),  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  and  Energy  (MONRE)  in  2016.  This committee developed the National AMR Containment Strategic Plan 2018-2022 using a One Health approach. The implementation plan of the delineates the plan to implement, monitor and evaluate the National AMR Containment Strategic Plan 2018-2022.

## 2. THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

Based on the National AMR Containment Strategic Plan 2018-2022, the Government will implement strategic objectives for the period of October  2020  to  September  2025.  This  is  the implementation plan after the development of the strategic plan, and it will take the following considerations into account:

- · Translate the strategic objectives to activities and actions.
- · Align the implementation plan with existing policies, regulations, and guidelines, and identify opportunities for improvement.
- · Align the implementation plan with funding support including the Fleming Fund support where relevant.
- · Improve the national coordination of the implementation of AMR surveillance strategies in the different sectors.
- · Monitor the implementation plan outputs and collate experiences for future adjustments.

The implementation plan will be operationalized by technical departments in the respective Ministries with support of implementing partners and other AMR stakeholders on key areas as detailed below. The coordination, monitoring and evaluation of the implementation plan will be conducted by the AMRCC according to their defined terms of reference.

## 2.1. Strategic Objective 1: Improve awareness and understanding of AMR through effective communication, education, and training

The focus of this strategic objective is to raise the awareness of the community on AMR through different means at different levels of the society. The relevant experts and officers in charge of communication, community mobilization and health promotion in respective ministries must be up to date with the current global and country AMR status, and equipped with the required knowledge and resources to raise awareness on issues pertaining to AMR in the country. They will  be  expected  to  work  closely  with  health  workers,  animal  &amp;  plant  health  workers,  and environmental experts at all levels under one health approach to contribute to increasing literacy on AMR in the Kingdom of Eswatini. This will be achieved through information, education, and communication  (IEC)  products  developed  and  disseminated  to  cross-sectoral  audiences including schools, the public and AMR stakeholders in various institutions. Detailed activities that will be undertaken to improve awareness and understanding of AMR are outlined in Table 1.

## 2.2. Strategic objective 2: Strengthen the knowledge and evidence base for AMR containment through surveillance and research

The key strategy to slowing down or preventing the emergence of AMR is to have a functional surveillance system  particularly  in  the  human  and  animal  health  sectors.  A  functional surveillance system will enable the Government of Eswatini to generate accurate and timely data on patterns of antimicrobial resistance, detect new and emerging resistance at an early stage and guide local treatment protocols. It will also enable utilization of AMR data to inform and  improve  programming  and  reporting  to  the  global  antimicrobial  resistance  surveillance system (GLASS). Developing a surveillance system will involve a comprehensive cross-sectoral situational  analysis/needs  assessment  to  identify  current  gaps  and  opportunities  in  policy guidelines and in existing information system infrastructure for surveillance. It will also involve a  review  of  the  current  national  health  research  agenda  to  include  AMR.  Activities  that  are planned under this strategic objective are detailed in Table 2.

## 2.3. Strategic Objective 3: Reduce the incidence of infection across human, environment, and animal communities and health care through individual and environmental sanitation, hygiene, and infection prevention measures

Good infection prevention control (IPC) practices are essential elements in a strategy to contain AMR.  The  Eswatini  AMR  strategic  action  to  improve  personal  and  environmental  hygiene coupled  with  IPC  measures  in  both  human  and  animal  health  sectors  will  stop  the  chain  of infection and reduce the spread of infections in humans and animals, in food establishments, and  in  the  community.  This  reduction  in  infection  will  in  turn  decrease  the  need  for antimicrobials and emergence of AMR. Activities that will be undertaken under this strategic objective to enhance IPC, personal, and environmental hygiene are detailed in Table 3.

Table  3:  Reduce  the  incidence  of  infection  across  human,  environment,  and  animal communities and health care through individual and environmental sanitation, hygiene, and infection prevention measures.

## 2.4. Strategic objective 4: Optimize the use of antimicrobial medicines in human and animal health through AMR stewardship

Use  of  antimicrobials,  even  when  rational  and  prudent,  can  precipitate  emergence  of resistance .  Over-prescription,  easy  access  to  over-the-counter  medicines,  and  lack  of  a 2 regulatory framework on rational use of antimicrobials all contribute towards the emergence of AMR. Strategies that will be used to address optimal use of antimicrobial medicines in Eswatini will  target  and  improve  the  antimicrobials  regulatory  framework,  availability  and  use  of treatment guidelines, improved prescribing practices by clinicians and veterinary practitioners, and appropriate use of antimicrobials by consumers and farmers.  Detailed activities that will be undertaken to actualize these strategies are outlined in Table 4.

## 2.5. Strategic objective 5: Enhance leadership, governance, coordination, and investment in containing AMR

Following the World Health Assembly (WHA) in May 2015 and its call for action, the Government took the first key step by establishing an AMRCC in 2016 with a mandate to coordinate the multisectoral implementation of the national action plan to tackle AMR. To be able to perform these duties, the AMRCC will be strengthened to exercise its role and responsibilities according to defined terms of reference and to effect government coordination across the health, agriculture, and environmental sectors. A strengthened AMRCC will also monitor implementation of the National AMR Containment Strategic Plan, work closely with donor and implementing partners

to raise awareness, and mobilize resources to accelerate implementation of the strategic plan. A close collaboration with the tripartite representatives (WHO, OIE, FAO) is instrumental to maximize technical support and gauging efforts to international standards in addition to the collaborations with regional organizations such as the African Union (AU), Africa CDC, Southern African Development Community (SADC) and African Society for Laboratory Medicine (ASLM).

A One Health Committee (OHC) which will be the highest reporting structure for governance and coordination and leadership of all 'One Health' public health related matters of the multisector  ministries  will  be  established  to  promote  the  one  health  approach  to  tackle  AMR.

## Membership of the OHC will be as follows:

- · Director of Health Services, MOH
- · Director of Veterinary and Livestock Services, MOA
- · Director of Agriculture/Chief Research Officer, MOA
- · Director of Water Affairs, MONRE
- · Director of Eswatini Tourism &amp; Environmental Authority
- · Subject Matter Chairpersons (to serve as Committee Secretariat)
- o AMRCC Chairperson/ Co-Chairperson
- o IHR Focal Person
- o Rabies Coordination
- o Communication Focal Persons
- o Any other organized specific group
- · CANGO
- · Country Representatives from WHO, FAO, and United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP).

Detailed activities that will be undertaken to enhance governance, coordination and investment are outlined in Table 5.

## 3. MONITORING AND EVALUATION FRAMEWORK

The monitoring and evaluation plan (M&amp;EP) is an important accompaniment to the national AMR containment implementation plan. The key component of the M&amp;EP is the performance framework (Table 6) detailing performance measures (indicators), targets, responsible persons, and timeline for each activity. Implementation of the annual operational plans will detail other components including a logic model, data collection and reporting tools, data sources and data management processes, and reporting frequency. Regular evaluation will also be undertaken at planned intervals to assess whether planned outcomes were achieved.
