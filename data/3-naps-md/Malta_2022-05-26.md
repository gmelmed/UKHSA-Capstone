Since penicillin started to be used in the 1940s, antibiotics have saved countless lives and contributed to the control of infectious diseases that previously used to cause untold death and suffering. However, this medical miracle risks turning into one of the biggest public health threats of our time. Excessive and inappropriate use of antibiotics has resulted  in  the development  of  Antimicrobial  Resistance  (AMR) throughout the world. Infections are now no longer being cured or prevented  by  the  same  antibiotics  which  were  so  effective  against them, just a decade or two ago. We face a real possibility of turning the clock back seventy years, when serious infections were untreatable. Just as worrying, medical advances like surgery  and  cancer  treatment  could  be  compromised  since  these  require  effective antibiotics to be successful.

Malta is not immune to this 'Microbial Threat'. For this reason, I am pleased to launch this Strategy  outlining  major  actions  and  priority  areas  which  will  be  addressed  for  the prevention and containment of AMR in Malta in the coming years. This Strategy and Action Plan focuses on improvements in surveillance, stewardship measures for the proper use of antibiotics, infection prevention and control as well as education and research.

AMR is not only a challenge in human healthcare but equally impacts on animal health and the environment. This complex, inter-related, problem requires concerted efforts by various stakeholders from a multitude of sectors - including healthcare specialists, veterinarians, pharmacists, educationalists, policy makers, legislative bodies, agriculture, industry and the public. The Ministry for Health is therefore proud to be leading this initiative through a 'One Health' collaboration with the Ministry for the Environment, Sustainable Development and Climate Change, with whom this Strategy was developed.

AMR can and does have an impact on people and on our health services. Working towards its prevention and containment is necessary to allow the key medicinal advances to remain effective and to ensure that we can continue to rely on antibiotics in the coming decades.

Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) has progressively raised concerns in many countries,  including  Malta.  The  issues  encompass  issues  of  microbes previously sensitive to antimicrobials which are now developing resistance to them. These resistant microbes may find themselves in the human body not only when they enter through direct means, but also indirectly when people consume foodstuffs from animal origin that may be contaminated with resistant microbes, e.g. meat, milk and eggs.

The  foodstuffs  from  animal  origin  may  also  contain  residues  of  antimicrobials  administered  to animals that may end up in the human body when the foodstuffs are consumed thereby contributing to the problem. For this purpose the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Animal Rights in tandem with  the  Ministry  for  Health  is  launching  a  'Strategy  and  Action  Plan  for  the  Prevention  and Containment of Antimicrobial Resistance intended to target the years 2020 - 2025'. This reflects the wider action plans on this important issue of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)'s, World Organisation for Animal Health Organisation and World Health Organisation (WHO)'s.

Antimicrobials have for the last eighty years played a crucial role in the treatment of both human and animal diseases. Their use in plants have sometimes been reported in a number of countries. However, the impudent use of antimicrobials is having an adverse effect on the health issues it intends to resolve so we should ensure that these are used properly. The use and administration of antimicrobials needs a proper holistic regulatory framework intended to prevent the abuse, misuse, and overuse of antimicrobials.

AMR will surely have long term implications which for now may be unseen (although present) for the  livestock  breeder  who  might  not  be  able  to  adequately  safeguard  the  proper  health  of  his livestock. The magical antimicrobial which today solves some of his issues might be useless in the long term due to AMR. This will have devastating consequences both for the farmer himself whose interest is to ensure a healthy livestock and also for the consumer himself who can end up harboring microbes resistant to antimicrobials.

Thus our Ministry together with the Health Ministry has embarked on this strategy and action plan, whereby all this is sought to be avoided in the long term. All measures indicated in this strategic plan should yield positive results on the long term and mitigate an otherwise worrying situation. The strategy focuses on measures such as improved hygiene and biosecurity in farms which will help farmers in reducing risks to overall animal health, increase cost effectively and at the same time ensuring a more prudent and controlled use of antimicrobials. This could be reached through a proper awareness program amongst all those involved including livestock breeders and veterinarians. On the other end co-operation from all stakeholders is the other ingredient for the success of the plan.

Hon. Anton Refalo Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Animal Rights.

## Glossary

## Antibiotic resistance

Refers to a property of bacteria that confers the capacity to grow in the presence of antibiotic levels that would normally suppress growth or kill susceptible bacteria.

## Antimicrobial

Refers to medicine that, on application to living tissue or by systemic administration, will selectively kill or prevent or inhibit growth of susceptible organisms.

## AMR

Refers to the ability of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites to resist the action of antimicrobials especially of antibiotics that would normally suppress growth or kill susceptible organisms.

## Animals

Refers to both food producing and non-food producing, including pets, pigeons and farmed fish.

## AWaRE list of antibiotics

Refers to the Essential Medicines List issued by WHO for adults and children; this includes:

- · ACCESS antibiotics which are first- and second-choice options for common infections and should be available in all countries and all facilities
- · WATCH antibiotics that should be prescribed only for specific indications, since they are at higher risk of bacterial resistance.
- · RESERVE antibiotics including last-resort options.

## 'Critical' antibiotics (human use)

Refers to those antibiotics used to treat serious or life-threatening infections in humans for which there are very limited or no alternative antibiotics that can be used to treat the infections if antibiotic resistance develops. The antibiotics that are in this critical class change from time to time and are influenced by the availability of newer antibiotics and the resistance rate of bacteria causing serious human infections.

## Community/primary care

Refers to healthcare provided in the community for people making an initial approach to a medical practitioner or clinic for advice or treatment.

## Food producing animals

Refers to land animals as well as fish that are reared for eating.

## Hospital care

Refers to healthcare provided in a public or private licensed institution providing medical and surgical treatment and nursing care for sick or injured people.

## Executive summary

Antibiotics are essential to medical practice because they are used to treat or prevent infectious diseases that might otherwise be lethal. Without antibiotics, lifesaving interventions such as intensive care, cancer treatment and many serious surgical procedures would not be possible because the risk of infection would be too high.

Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) occurs when an antibiotic is no longer effective on bacteria it previously used to destroy. In common with many Mediterranean countries, the prevalence of AMR in Malta is significantly higher than several other regions within the European Union (EU), especially Scandinavia. These local challenges manifest themselves in both Human Health - in hospital and community settings, as well as in veterinary practice. The greatest challenge resides in  the  increasing  levels  of  Carbapenem  Resistant  Enterobacteriaceae  (CRE)  which  can  be resistant to all known antibiotics and therefore untreatable; they threaten to turn the clock to the days before Fleming discovered penicillin.

The AMR Strategy is a cross-sectoral response to the threat of AMR in Malta with the aim of controlling and possibly reversing these current AMR trends. It has been informed by a review of national and international literature as well as expert advice from key stakeholders, especially the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The Strategy aligns with the World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance, the EU Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance as well as National legislation. It recognises the interconnectedness  of  humans,  animals  and  the  environment  and  adopts  a  whole  of Government,  a  whole  of  society  and  a  comprehensive  One  Health  Approach  to  AMR, recognizing the complexity of the issue.

The main strategic aims of the AMR Strategy are to:

- 1. Strengthen the infrastructure needed to address the AMR situation through adequate support of the inter-sectoral coordinating mechanism (ICM), appropriate legislation and strengthening  of  relevant  surveillance  and  feedback  systems  in  Human  and  Animal Health as well as the environment.
- 2. Foster  improved  awareness  and  education  on  AMR  among  healthcare  professionals, veterinary professionals, livestock keepers, animal owners and the public, as well as the measures needed to prevent it.
- 3. Introduce overarching measures to ensure appropriate antibiotic prescribing and use in community, hospitals and veterinary practice and in both Human and Animal Health sectors.
- 4. Improve  Infection  Prevention  and  Control  (IPC)  through  national  coordination  and oversight,  implementation  of  effective  IPC  multi-modal  strategies  in  all  healthcare facilities (with the control of CRE designated as a national priority) and foster hygiene standards in farms to prevent cross-transmission of animal pathogens.
- 5. Encourage and support innovation, research and networking in areas relevant to AMR.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) refers to the ability of microorganisms to resist the action of  antimicrobials,  occurring  when  such  microorganisms  (e.g.  bacteria,  fungi,  viruses  and parasites affecting humans, land-dwelling and aquatic animals and plants) become resistant to  antimicrobials  such  as  antibiotics,  making  infections  or  diseases  caused  by  such microorganisms more difficult or impossible to treat. Antimicrobials play a critical role for ensuring health and productivity when judicially used. However, when imprudently used they  can  lead  to the associated  emergence  and  spread  of  antimicrobial  resistant microorganisms, placing everyone at great risk.

While bacterial resistance  to  antibiotics  has  developed  rapidly  and has  become  a  major threat, a slowly  emerging  phenomenon  of  resistance  of  other  micro-organisms  to antimicrobials  such  as  antifungals,  antivirals  and  anti-parasitic  agents  have  also  been observed.  Since  bacterial  AMR  to  antibiotics  constitutes  the  largest  significant  threat  of AMR,  the  Strategy  focuses  on  antibiotic  resistance  and  does  not  encompass  other antimicrobial resistance, which has so far been on the low side.

The challenge of AMR is complex and no single action will, in isolation, provide an effective response. For this reason, the Strategy is a cross-sectoral response to the threat of AMR in Malta. Its focus lies in controlling and possibly reversing current AMR trends. The Strategy sets out aims that identify the broad areas where integrated and simultaneous action is required.  Progress  in  each  area  is  important  to  ensure  a  comprehensive  response  and support progress towards the Strategy's vision.

The aims, objectives and actions needed to achieve this vision have been informed by a review  of  national  and  international  literature as well as expert  advice  from  key stakeholders.  The  Strategy  aligns  with  the  WHO  Global  Action  Plan  on  Antimicrobial Resistance, the EU Action on Antimicrobial Resistance as well as National Legislation.

With the aim of maintaining efficacy of antibiotics for both humans and animals for the long term  and  to  improve  Human  and  Animal  Health,  the  Strategy  sets  priorities  for  future actions, whilst highlighting good practice initiatives which are already being implemented to  address  AMR.  Some  actions  are  concerned  with  adapting  and  extending  existing successful initiatives whilst others focus on identified gaps that require new areas of action.

The Strategy recognises the interconnectedness of humans, animals and the environment. In view of the complexity of the issue, it adopts a whole of Government, a whole of society and a comprehensive One Health Approach to AMR. The Strategy, therefore, underscores the need for co-ordinated action by many stakeholders in Malta who are responsible for the different actions within the Strategy including Government, private and public partners and the public across the human, animal and environment sectors. Whilst individual actions are important,  many  are  interrelated  and  specific  actions  in  one  area  contribute  to  the achievement of multiple objectives.

## 1.1. The problem of AMR

AMR occurs due to  changes  in  bacterial  genetic  material  which  can  arise  either  due  to mutations  or  through  the  acquisition  of  resistance  genes  from  other  bacteria.  Various resistance genes can be exchanged or acquired between different species of bacteria and can  lead  to  the  development  of  multi-drug-resistant  organisms  (MDRO).  As  a  result  of antibiotics killing off sensitive bacteria, resistant bacteria are allowed to proliferate further and therefore become predominant.

Since  their  discovery  in  the  early  20 th Century  antibiotics  have  revolutionised  medicine. Antibiotics are essential to medical practice because they can be used to treat infectious diseases  that  might  otherwise  be  lethal.  Infections,  which  had  previously  killed  millions, suddenly became treatable. The prompt administration of antibiotics in the treatment of certain  conditions  has  also  been  proven  to  reduce  morbidity  and  mortality.  Without antibiotics,  lifesaving  interventions  such  as  intensive  care,  cancer  treatment  and  many serious surgical procedures would not be possible because the risk of infection would be too high.

However, as we move towards a century of antibiotic use, the availability of antibiotics that are effective is significantly threatened by the development and spread of AMR, making the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases more difficult and challenging.

## 1.2. The burden of AMR and its significance to Public Health

The emergence and spread of microbes resistant to the most effective antimicrobial agents, places medical advances in jeopardy. The resultant higher patient morbidity and mortality, together with increasing healthcare costs, are becoming major challenges worldwide. This is especially  important  to  consider  in  the  context  of  an  ageing  population  which  is generating a greater demand for healthcare services including antibiotic use.

Whilst the health, social and economic burden due to AMR is significant, it is difficult to quantify precisely because of deficiencies in the available data for many countries. It is even more difficult to estimate the additional human burden associated with AMR such as pain and  psychosocial  costs.  Inappropriate  use  of  antibiotics  leads  to  wastage  and  higher medication costs; second and third line antibiotics often need to be used, coupled with additional  investigations,  consultation  time  and  nursing  care  as  well  as  the  additional burden on hospitals. In addition, patients, their family and society endure loss in income, reduced worker productivity and added family support which all contribute to the social and economic  burden  generated  by  infections  due  to  resistant  microbes.  Furthermore,  the social and economic burden is exacerbated by associated mortality.

Estimates from Europe indicate that every year around 25,000 deaths are attributable to infections caused by a selection of multidrug-resistant bacteria. The estimated global yearly economic burden due to infections resulting from extra healthcare costs and productivity losses due to MDROs exceeds 1.5 billion euros per year.

Recent European reports have provided new evidence on the burden of AMR in Malta. A 2019  ECDC  publication  estimates  that  25  to  35  Maltese  die  every  year  from  infections caused by AMR organisms (Cassini, et. al., 2019). OECD has recently reported that AMR is

resulting  in  direct  costs  of  more  than  €3,000,000  a  year  to  the  Maltese  economy.  It estimates that, in a worst-case scenario, in which no antimicrobial treatment is effective, AMR infection could cause healthcare losses of more than 6000 hospital days, and almost 20  million  euros,  a  year.    Fig  1  demonstrates  estimated  average  annual  health  care expenditure associated with AMR across OECD modelled countries.  Malta is estimated to have the highest healthcare expenditure as a consequence of a 100% resistance scenario (OECD, 2018).

## 2. BACKGROUND

## 2.1 Global and European initiatives to counteract AMR

Recent G7, G20 fora and United Nations discussions on this subject show that the scale of the  problem  requires  a  concerted  global  governance  effort.  The  increase  in  AMR experienced in recent decades has seen it designated as a Public Health priority by all major stakeholders. The WHO, in its Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (2015), which was subsequently adopted by the World Animal Health Organisation (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation, the United Nations Political Declaration on AMR (2016) and the European  Union  One  Health  Action  Plan  against  Antimicrobial  Resistance  (2011)  as amended  in  2016  through  'A  European  One  Health  Action  Plan  against  Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)' highlight the efforts necessary to address this global treat. They have consequently, published roadmaps aiming to control AMR. These Strategies emphasise the importance of national, regional, and international collaboration for the control and spread of resistance. Through WHA 67.25 and 68.7 the WHO calls upon all member states to have in place by 2017 national action plans on AMR.

Between  2001  and  2010,  European  countries  collected  resistance  data  through  the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS). As of 2011, EARSS, whose new acronym is EARS-Net, has become fully integrated in the ECDC database (TESSy). The EU additionally established the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption (ESAC) to monitor the consumption of antibiotics in both the inpatient and outpatient sectors.

Northern European countries tend to report a lower resistance prevalence compared to countries in the south and east of Europe. These geographical differences in AMR could be

explained  by  differences  in  IPC  practices  and  antibiotic  consumption.  For  instance,  the antibiotic consumption rate in the community tends to be low in Scandinavian countries whereas Southern European countries have high levels of antibiotic use. Compared to other European  countries,  broad-spectrum  antibiotics  are  also  prescribed  more  frequently  in Mediterranean countries, in both community and hospital settings.

## 3. CURRENT SITUATION OF AMR IN HUMAN HEALTH IN MALTA

## 3.1 AMR Epidemiology

Malta is not immune to the significant challenge of AMR. Indeed, in common with most Mediterranean countries, several drug-bug resistance combinations are locally prevalent in significantly greater proportions than other EU regions, especially northern countries, which tend  to  report  lower  resistance.  These  local  challenges  manifest  themselves  in  Human Health - at hospital and community settings - as well as in the animal sector. More details on the status of AMR in key pathogens, relevant to human and Animal Health, can be found in Appendix I.

## 3.2 Antimicrobial Consumption

Several local  datasets  have  provided  indicative trends  and  levels  of  use  of  antimicrobial agents both in the community as well as in the hospital setting. The data suggests that major challenges  are  present  in  the  community,  possibly  due  to  a  culture  of  over-prescribing antibiotics as well as to doctors acceding to patient demands. Whilst non-prescribed use of antibiotics has reduced drastically in the past decade (from over 18% in 2002 to around 1% of total usage as reported by the 2016 Eurobarometer survey), the same cannot be said for inappropriate  prescribing.  Almost  half  of  the  Maltese  participants  in  the  same  survey reported being prescribed at least one course of antibiotics during 2015. Most respondents reported that it was prescribed for a cold, influenza or sore throat - conditions for which antibiotics are not normally indicated. The Eurobarometer results have been confirmed by other local post-graduate dissertations. Most antibiotics prescribed in the community are highly broad spectrum in nature; with co-amoxiclav, cefuroxime and ciprofloxacin being the three most commonly prescribed. These are well known to be greater drivers of resistance than the narrower spectrum equivalents.

Trends of consumption of antibiotics within Mater Dei Hospital (MDH), (the main hospital in the country), have stabilised in recent years, especially in high consuming units such as Intensive Care, Nephrology and Haematology, where antibiotic stewardship programmes have been introduced with some success. Nevertheless, use per capita is well above the European  average.  Additionally,  the  over-use  of  broad-spectrum  products  (especially carbapenems) remains a challenge together with excessively prolonged and unnecessary use of antibiotics for surgical prophylaxis.

## 3.3 Healthcare Associated Infections

Data about the prevalence of healthcare associated infections (HAI) is available only for MDH. Results from the 2011-2012 European Point Prevalence Survey (PPS), undertaken by ECDC, placed the prevalence of HAI in Maltese hospitals at the lower half of the European median;  the  actual  prevalence  was  lower  than  what  could  be  predicted  from  patient characteristics and case mix. In addition, significant improvement has been registered in the incidence of bloodstream infections in intensive care as well as several types of surgical site infections, especially those related to prosthetic hip and knee replacement surgery.

## 4. Current Situation of AMR in Animal Health AND Plant Health in Malta

## 4.1 AMR Epidemiology

Information on AMR in isolates of animal origin remains extremely sparse and restricted to a  very  limited  set  of  isolates  tested  annually  at  the  National  Veterinary  Laboratory,  in compliance  with  EU  minimal  requirements.  Yet,  even  from  this  limited  information,  it appears that AMR in animals is a significant problem. The level of resistance to ciprofloxacin in Salmonella spp. in local broiler flocks tested in 2016 was 50%, while 48.8% of the isolates were resistant  to  nalidixic  acid.  This  trend  is  consistent  with  the  average  occurrence  of resistance in the EU for these antibiotics. 2.5% of the isolates were resistant to cefotaxime and 1.3% were resistant to ceftazidime. At the same time, 67.7 of E. coli strains from the same source were also resistant to ciprofloxacin and 64.5% were resistant to nalidixic acid.

In May 2017 Malta undertook a surface waters monitoring exercise covering the testing for all substances listed in Directive 2015/495/EU, which established a watchlist of substances for Union-wide monitoring in the field of water policy pursuant to Directive 2008/105/EC. This data was also reported to the EU Commission. Another monitoring exercise will follow up and cover an updated list of substances as per Implementing Decision 2018/840/EC. Action targeting pharmaceuticals in the environment is also being developed and addressed at EU level. Article 8 of Directive 2008/105/EC (amended by Directive 2013/39/EU) obliges the  European  Commission  to  develop  a  strategic  approach  to  water  pollution  from pharmaceutical substances. The Strategy, which is in its final stages of drafting, includes tackling antimicrobial resistance as a key aim.

## 4.2 Antimicrobial Consumption

Detailed information on antibiotic use in animals in Malta is also significantly limited. Malta started  providing  sales  data  of  antimicrobials  to  the  European  Medicines  Authority's European Surveillance of Veterinary Antimicrobial Consumption (ESVAC) network in 2018 for  the  year  2017.  Antimicrobials  are  used  in  different  species  for  various  conditions including  when  the  indication  is  not  listed  in  the  product  specification  for  a  particular species (off label use or cascade use).

Critically  important  antibiotics  for  human  medicine  also  exist  in  formulations  for  use  in veterinary medicine.   Amongst others, they are said to be used to treat urinary disease in cats, respiratory disease in cattle, diarrhoea in cattle and swine, locomotion disorders in cattle, post-partum dysgalactia syndrome in swine and dental disease in dogs. Metaphylactic use of antibiotics is reportedly resorted to at times, in the rearing of broilers.

Regulation  60  of  Subsidiary  Legislation  437.47  requires  all  antimicrobial  Veterinary Medicinal Products to be obtained following a veterinarian's prescription. These pharmaceuticals are also allegedly sourced from a range of sources including from other farmers, visiting veterinarians, from other Member States, direct personal imports and from retail  outlets  not  approved  by  the  Veterinary  Services.  The  quantities  of  antimicrobials sourced  in  such  ways  is  not  known.  These  issues  also  present  challenges  for  the implementation of policies for the prudent use of antimicrobials.

## 4.2.1 Aquatic farming

The aquatic sector benefits from the prudent use of antimicrobials in terms of improving on-farm biosecurity and husbandry (e.g. use of vaccines and disinfectants), treating chronic diseases  (that  cause  reduced  growth,  low  food  conversion  rate  and  poor  survival  thus leading  to  reduced  production)  and  epizootic  diseases  that  can  cause  mass  mortalities. Nevertheless, there are some local concerns regarding threats posed by abuse, overuse, misuse, environmental and ecological issues, antimicrobial residues and AMR.

## 4.3 Plant Health

There is a global increase in concern that overuse or misuse of antimicrobials to manage plant  pests  is  creating  a  selection  pressure  in  the  production  environment,  which  can accelerate  the  development  and  spread  of  AMR  in  the  environment.  It  is  not  only  the antimicrobials that should be regarded as environmental contaminants, but also the genes that  confer  AMR.  Many  countries  do  not  approve  antibiotics  as  active  ingredients  in pesticides, and such pesticides are, so far, not known to be imported into Malta, reducing the  potential  risk  of  AMR  development  and  so  far  keeping  the  development  of  pest resistance to pesticides.

## 5. EXISTING ACTIVITIES TO ADDRESS AMR IN MALTA

## 5.1 Legislation regulating Human Health and Animal Sector

Legislation directly related to AMR is limited. Current legislation requires that all antibiotics used for human patients (including topical formulations) as well as food animals, should be Prescription Only Medicines.

Subsidiary Legislation 465.08 of 2008 established the National Antibiotic Committee (NAC), a committee that serves as the Intersectoral Coordinating Mechanism for Malta. The NAC has  representation  from  various  professional  groups  involved  in  the  prescribing  and dispensing of antibiotics although it does not include participation of non-prescribers or the

public.  Most  of  its  past  activities  have  focused  on  Human  Health.    Animal  Health interventions have been minimal. The main role of the NAC has been primarily educational, both in terms of guideline development as well as educational campaigns aimed at both healthcare professionals as well as the public. It is legally empowered to collect wholesaler antibiotic sales data.

The NAC is limited in its output due to lack of adequate resources both financial and human. Ad hoc funds have been provided over the years, especially in activities related to European Antibiotic Awareness Day; this has allowed a basic level of activity to be maintained on a yearly basis. Other than to undertake collection and analysis of data related to ambulatory-care antibiotic consumption, no administrative support is available to the NAC.

Various  legislation  is  in  place  in  relation  to  Animal  Health  as  per  EU/EC  regulations, directives, actions and decisions. EU guidelines have been adopted and adapted as needed. However,  there  is  lack of legislation covering  prescription, distribution, marketing, dispensing and retail of all veterinary medicinal products including antibiotics for animals. This  is  a  barrier  that  is  considered  a  central  issue  by  both  veterinary  regulators  and practitioners. In addition, tools to enforce the current Veterinary Services Act are either lacking or not sufficiently robust.

There  is  anecdotal  information  of  the  ease  of  availability  of  antibiotics  and  other pharmaceuticals for livestock over the counter by both veterinary pharmacies as well as retail outlets not approved by the Veterinary Services.  This has resulted in a situation where veterinarians are not being called to farms except in last resort situations, with farmers preferring to carry out 'do-it-yourself' care on their animals. This situation is of concern from an AMR as well as from an animal welfare point of view. The lack of veterinary presence on farms  is  also  resulting  in  a  lack  of  crucial  input  in  farm  management  issues,  such  as vaccination  programmes  as  well  as    general  farm  practices.  This  often  results  in  the development of medical problems in calves and cows such as diarrhoea and mastitis which go untreated or not properly treated, as highlighted, in particular, by those veterinarians who are ready to offer farm veterinary services.

One possible historic reason for this situation can be traced to a past system where the farmers' co-operative employed veterinarians to offer a veterinary service to dairy farms without cost to farmers. This potentially led to an ingrained culture among farmers that made them unwilling and/or unable to afford to pay for veterinary services themselves when this free service ceased.

The Regulation on transmissible animal diseases ('Animal Health Law') of March 2016 sets out  a  legal basis for monitoring  animal  pathogens  resistant  to  antibiotics.  This  is supplemented by the regulations on veterinary medicines and on medicated feed.

Subsidiary Legislation 437.47 obliges the Marketing Authorisation Holder to comply with any request from the VPRD to provide information about the volume of sales or prescription of  veterinary  medicinal  products.  Compliance  is  generally  satisfactory  for  data  that  is currently requested.

Challenges  in  human  and  financial  resources  at  the  VPRD  together  with  ever  increasing complexity  of  regulatory  controls  constitute  a  major  challenge  to  achieve  effective implementation.

Major legislative lacunas exist in both human and animal sectors. In Human Health and Animal Health, Legislative provisions directly relevant to AMR prevention are lacking.  The absence of legal notices covering patient safety and infection prevention and control exacerbates the situation. In animal health there are no regulations to cover antibiotic formulations that consider AMR.

## 5.2 Interventions to address AMR in Human Health

## 5.2.1 AMR surveillance

The surveillance of AMR at MDH is already well established and on par (if not above average) to that performed in most EU hospitals. This relates both to day to day surveillance and outbreak  detection  as  well as monitoring  of  trends. Regular  feedback  of  data is communicated to decision makers as well as healthcare workers. Other public hospitals are also notified in real time of AMR isolates of concern. Epidemiology of AMR in these hospitals can be extracted from the central MDH laboratory database, however, the frequency of specimen taking is significantly lower than in MDH and therefore accurate epidemiological conclusions are more difficult to achieve.

Information  about  AMR  in  the  community  is  less  robust.  While  data  about  community samples sent for culture and sensitivity at the Microbiology Laboratory at MDH is available, these tend to originate from patients failing first line treatment in the community and are therefore skewed towards higher resistance profiles. There is currently no requirement for private laboratories and/or hospitals to report AMR to the National Antibiotic Committee.

## 5.2.2 Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption

Surveillance of antibiotic use has also been long established at MDH, where historical trends of  consumption  are  available  by  Anatomical  Therapeutic  Chemical  (ATC)  Classification System,  against  bed  day  denominators.  In  addition,  audits  of  restricted  antibiotics, especially  carbapenems,  have  been  undertaken  using  hospital  guidelines  as  the  gold comparative standard. Indicators of overuse and misuse have been established. Knowledge about antibiotic use patterns in other hospitals is not generally available.

Community consumption is more problematic. In the absence of a national reimbursement system or electronic prescribing infrastructure, obtaining data at prescriber/pharmacy level has  proven  close  to  impossible.  As  a  compromise,  wholesaler  distribution  statistics  are collected on a yearly basis and used as a proxy.

Both hospital and community data sets are submitted on a yearly basis to the ESAC-Net network coordinated by ECDC. However, since the method of data collection of ambulatory care consumption differs from that of most EU countries participating in this network (who have access to reimbursement data), benchmarking can only be done on an approximate basis.  The  results  of  the  Eurobarometer  Surveys  on  antibiotic  use,  where  a  standard methodology is utilised across all countries, are more accurate.

## 5.2.3 Infection Prevention and Control (IPC)

The  Infection  Control  Department  (ICD)  at  MDH  coordinates  all  activities  related  to  the prevention and control of HAI in the hospital. It also provides technical assistance, when requested by other public hospitals, each of which now have an appointed Practice Nurse in  IPC.  The  ICD  has  developed  a  comprehensive  set  of  policies  and  Standard  Operating Procedures that are also used by the other public hospitals, is active in IPC education and organises  an  annual  national  conference.  The  Unit  also  adopts  a  Plan-Do-Study-Act approach utilising Root Cause Analysis tools to identify and address causative factors for serious infections, such as MRSA bacteraemia. In addition, a strong emphasis is placed on process audits including hand hygiene facilities and performance, management of central lines, peripheral venous cannula care, compliance with contact precautions, and environmental cleaning amongst others. A formal IPC setup in other hospitals and clinics is not required nor regulated.

## 5.2.4 Education

Education  on  AMR  of  healthcare  professionals  at  undergraduate  levels  is  somewhat heterogeneous. In the MD course run by the University of Malta, there has been a significant increase in IPC related lectures and tutorials (medical students receive more than 15 hours on IPC) but at the same time there has been a reduction in contact time on antimicrobial agent pharmacology. Undergraduate teaching in Pharmacy also dedicates a considerable (proportionally greater) quantity of lectures to infection prevention (including vaccination) and,  as  expected,  pharmacology  of  antimicrobial  agents.  Historically,  undergraduate education in nursing has always had a strong component of IPC; however, in recent years, coverage was reduced; topics have been interspersed in various modules and not always taught by specialists in the field. Unfortunately, the situation is even worse in the allied health sciences, where undergraduate instruction in AMR and IPC is sparse, at best.

Post graduate education in AMR and antibiotic prescribing is generally unstructured other than in the Specialist Training Programme for family doctors, where at least one session is dedicated to antibiotic prescribing. There are no AMR related CPD requirements for any healthcare profession and, not surprisingly, activities are often sub-optimal. Family doctors are  the  professional  group  most  exposed  to  CPD  activities  related  to  infectious  disease management and antibiotic prescribing. Unfortunately, although normally organised under the umbrella of a professional society, these activities are invariably sponsored by industry and often include a promotional introduction by the sponsor.

Education  of  the  public  has  so  far  been  primarily  in  relation  to  the  European  Antibiotic Awareness Day. The lack of a dedicated budget and resources causes planning challenges. Dissemination  of  information  has  relied  on  billboards  as  well  as  media  opportunities through radio and TV talk shows. Despite their restricted nature, these activities have had an impact that appears to outweigh the level of investment. Nevertheless, there are still major challenges in public education and awareness. According to the 2015 Eurobarometer survey only 27% of Maltese were aware that antibiotics do not kill viruses, and 39% knew of  their  ineffectiveness  against  colds  and  flu.  Education  on  AMR,  appropriate  use  of antibiotics and infection prevention in schools is almost completely lacking.

## 5.2.5 Research

Over  the  past  decade,  the  MDH-ICD  has  participated  in  various  EU  funded  research programmes  including  ARMed  (as  project  coordinator),  BURDEN  and  IMPLEMENT.  The paucity of funding opportunities means that local research initiatives are largely restricted to  ad-hoc  studies  undertaken  as  part  of  undergraduate  and  postgraduate  dissertations, especially B.Sc. Medical Laboratory Science and M.Sc. Biomedical studies (Microbiology). Although limited in scope, the data generated by these studies have, however, provided invaluable information on local AMR epidemiology.

## 5.3 Interventions to address AMR in Animal Health and the Environment

## 5.3.1 AMR surveillance

AMR surveillance in animals is currently very restricted and carried out by the National Veterinary  Laboratory  only  on  resistance  of Salmonella species  in  poultry  (layers  and broilers) and swine as well as for E. coli under Decision 2013/652. Surveillance on bovine species reared in Malta is not compulsory because calves are not slaughtered. Other species such as rabbit, ovine and caprine are not targeted as this is not an EU requirement. National legislation  allows  for  the  slaughtering  of  small numbers of  rabbits on  farms  without the presence of the official veterinarian on site. However, it does except the farm from being monitored if they are registered with the Food Safety Commission.

There  are  currently  no  laboratories  in  Malta  that  can  provide  a  suitable  service  for performing routine diagnostic and susceptibility tests. Consequently, samples must be sent to other countries for analysis but this is rarely done due to the costs involved, logistical issues (e.g. ensuring suitable conditions for sample transport) and time taken to receive the result. Consequently, obtaining a realistic picture of AMR has proved to be challenging.

Currently,  surface  water  is  periodically  monitored  for  pollutants  of  concern,  including antibiotics, by the Environment and Resource Authority (ERA). The Life IP project is currently ongoing and aims to identify emerging pollutants including in groundwater, run-off and polished  water.  No  monitoring  of  air,  soil,  irrigation  water  and  forage  crops  is  being undertaken for antibiotic residues.

## 5.3.2 Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption

Each year all registered local distributors of veterinary medicinal products and distributors of  medicated  feed  are  required  to  supply  the  VPRD  with  information  on  the  sales  of antibiotics for that year. The single licensed medicated feeding mill in Malta also supplies VPRD with  information  on  the  sales  of  medicated  premix  for  each  medicated  feedstuff manufactured. This is used as a proxy for consumption.

The data received have been of variable quality. As of 2017 the process for data collection, reporting and evaluation has been reviewed and data analysis intensified. As of 2018 the data collected is more reflective of the local situation. Since 2016, Malta started giving sales

data on antimicrobials to the OIE and also started participating in the ESVAC project on the sales of antimicrobials in 2018.

The situation is complicated by possible use of antimicrobials intended for human medicine, but which are used in animals under the cascade (provided for by Articles 10 and 11 of Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products) which allows for off-label use.  This  can  be  tackled  by  eventually  measuring  antimicrobial  use  at  farm  level  using several additional tools, for example through electronic prescription. Such tools will also help  for  non-food  producing  animals  since  the  cascade  is  more  readily  used  in  the prescription of treatment for these animals.

## 5.3.3 Education

Previous local experience with educational initiatives targeting veterinarians and farmers did not yield the expected results in terms of compliance with the regulatory requirements, other than some improvement in the dairy sector. It is not clear whether the improvement in the diary sector was due to the success of these educational initiatives or the 'crosscompliance  programme'.  This  programme  links  direct  payments  through  the  Common Agricultural Policy to compliance  by  farmers  with  basic standards concerning  the environment, food safety, animal and plant health and animal welfare.

The website of the VPRD includes a risk-based scoring tool that evaluates the quality of biosecurity of a herd. The tool can help with the reduction of antimicrobial usage and to improve the general land-dwelling Animal Health situation. Farmers can make use of this tool to assess the biosecurity level in their farms. The website also includes a comprehensive formulary of Veterinary Medicinal Products to be used for specific diseases in companion animals (including racing pigeons) listing the first and subsequent line of treatment. The suggested treatments only include the currently authorised veterinary medicinal products in  Malta.  An  explanation  of  scientific  factors  related  to  the  possible  spread  of AMR  in humans from companion animals and the proven efficacious treatment for specific diseases is also included.

At present there is no undergraduate university course for veterinarians in Malta. A leading vocational education and training institution provides a course leading to B.Sc. in Animal Management  and  Veterinary  Nursing.  Efforts  have  been  made  to  include  or  increase emphasis on subjects related with AMR in this course. Furthermore, there is a proposal to include veterinary medicinal products (with an emphasis on AMR) in the undergraduate programme leading to a degree in pharmacy to bridge some of the gap between education and industry thus enhancing interest in the subject.

Circulars have been issued as guidance on prudent use of critically important antimicrobials by VPRD.  These guidelines are addressed to pharmacists, wholesale dealers and veterinarians and are publicly available on the VPRD website.

The Veterinary Surgeon Council has issued a series of documents as a guide for Professional Conduct which draws attention to the legal and ethical obligations related to the prudent use  of  veterinary  medicinal  products.  It  is  obligatory  to  adhere  to  this  guidance  and sanctions may be taken against veterinarians who do not follow it. In addition, the Malta

Veterinary Association, a non-profit body, issues information to its members on the prudent use of antimicrobials as part of its activities to promote professional knowledge, science and practice.

## 6. RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS

The control and prevention of the development and spread of AMR depends on various professionals and entities, in both public and private sectors, spanning the Human Health and  Animal  Health  sectors  as  well  as  the  agricultural,  aquaculture  and  environmental sectors. In addition, Government commitment is also paramount for the success of this AMR Strategy.

Key stakeholders in the implementation of this Strategy include:

- · Ministries responsible for Human Health, Animal Health, Plant Health and Education
- · Professionals involved in antibiotic prescribing and dispensing for humans and animals
- · National Antibiotic Committee
- · Public Health authorities
- •
- Healthcare workers providing patient care
- · Farmers, animal owners and stakeholders involved in animal sectors and aquaculture
- · Medicines Authority
- · Hospital-based entities (public and private) · Professional Organisations
- · Long-term care facilities
- · Pharmaceutical Industry and wholesalers
- · Community practitioners
- · Public
- · Schools and child-care facilities
- · Pharmacies
- · Universities and educational institutions responsible for training of professionals

## 7. FRAMEWORK FOR ACTION

## 7.1 Vision

The  vision  is  to  create  a  society  in  which  antimicrobials  are  available,  recognised  and managed as a valuable shared resource, maintaining their efficacy through appropriate use so that infections in humans and animals remain treatable, lives are not threatened, and communities continue to benefit from the advances that antimicrobials enable.

## 7.2 Guiding Principle

The guiding principle leading the Strategy is that of One Health. This principle recognises the  inextricable  link  between  humans,  animals and the  environment  and  emphasis that achieving optimal health outcomes for people and animals requires the collaboration and cooperation  of  Human  Health,  Animal  Health  and  the  environment.  Interdisciplinary collaboration which needs to be facilitated at various levels including national, through a whole  of  government  approach,  and  international  is  critical  between  the  numerous stakeholders.

## 7.3 Aim of the Strategy

The aim of this Strategy is to provide a plan of action for Malta, designed to ensure the efficacy of antibiotics for the long term. This focuses on the appropriate use of antibiotics and minimising the development and spread of AMR, thereby improving Human and Animal Health.

## 7.4 Overall Objectives

- · Review  current  relevant  legislation  to  strengthen  governance  to  prevent  and counteract  AMR  and  address  the  gaps  in  legislation  and  regulation  to  ensure leadership,  engagement  and  accountability  for  actions  to  combat  antimicrobial resistance.
- · Implement effective One Health antimicrobial stewardship practices across Human and  Animal  Health  settings  to  ensure  the  appropriate  and  prudent  prescribing, dispensing and administering of antimicrobials.
- · Develop nationally coordinated One Health surveillance of AMR and antimicrobial usage.
- · Improve  infection  prevention  and  control  measures  across  Human  Health  and Animal Health settings to help prevent infections and the spread of AMR.
- · Increase awareness and understanding of the use of antibiotics to treat and prevent infections through education and training.
- · Agree on a national research agenda and promote investment to prevent, detect and contain antimicrobial resistance.
- · Strengthen  international  partnerships and  collaboration  on  regional  and  global efforts to respond to AMR.

## 7.5 Strategic Priority Areas for Action

The  Strategy  provides  a  framework  to  guide  actions  on  AMR  and  use  of  antibiotics.  It coordinates activities across stakeholder groups where all stakeholders must work under the Strategy to change those practices that are contributing to the inappropriate use of antibiotics and the increasing development of resistance in Malta. The Strategy aims to build on the current strengths and address areas where deficits have been identified for each objective (Appendix 2). In order to achieve full implementation of the Strategy, a number of pre-requisites  (such  as  improved  legislation  and  adequate  infrastructure  that  enhances enforcement, electronic prescribing) are required.

Implementation and evaluation of the Strategy will be supported by an Implementation Plan that provides the detail of specific actions, targets, time frames and indicators. The Plan will be developed during 2018-2019 in consultation with stakeholders. Implementation will take a staged approach over the period 2018-2025.

The Objectives and their Priority Action areas are outlined below.

## Objective 1: Legislation and infrastructure

Ensure the necessary legislation and infrastructure to address AMR and implement effective strategies.

The following actions are required to ensure a more robust legislative framework:

- 1.1 Review  and  update  legislation  relevant  to  antimicrobial  usage  and  antimicrobial resistance and its enforcement.
- 1.2 Develop a regulatory framework for a One Health Approach in implementing this Strategy.
- 1.3 Strengthen enforcement and monitoring of compliance with relevant legislation.
- 1.4 Review  the  role  of  the  NAC  by  regulating  for  more  robust  responsibilities, accompanied by appropriate funding and resources for its effective functioning.
- 1.5 Introduce  appropriate  legislation  to  establish  minimum  standards  for  infection prevention and control in Human Healthcare and residential care institutions.
- 1.6 Introduce,  with  urgency,  legislation  that  would  regulate  on  antimicrobial  use  in veterinary practice so as to ensure full compliance with all EU Medicine Veterinary legislation and EU Directive 2001/82/EC.
- 1.6.1 In  so  doing,  establish the need of a prescription for all antibiotics used in animal health and other important requirements in the regulation of veterinary medicinal products.
- 1.7 Develop a framework to ensure adherence to legal obligations in line with local and EU requirements relating to correct antibiotic use under veterinary oversight, and infection prevention on farms.
- 1.7.1 Identify, through a consultative process, the respective roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders in complying with these requirements and develop the legal framework for animal health plans on farms, which are commensurate with their scale of activity.
- 1.8 Review  and/or  establish  legislation  to  ensure  adequate  wastewater  treatment systems to prevent discharge of antibiotics into the environment.

## Objective 2: Stewardship

Implement effective antimicrobial stewardship practices across Human Health and Animal Health settings to ensure the appropriate and prudent prescribing, dispensing, administering and disposal of antimicrobials .

The following actions are required for effective antimicrobial stewardship:

| 2.1   | Introduce  and/or  improve  evidence-based,  easily  accessible,  national  antibiotic  guidelines, in both human (community, hospital settings as well as long term care  facilities) and animal health (both treatment and metaphylaxis).                                                                                                          |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2.1.1 | Ensure  that  all  antibiotics  recommended  in  the  national  guidelines,  especially  narrow-spectrum formulations, are stocked by, and can be easily obtained from, all  pharmacies (both public and private).                                                                                                                                   |
| 2.2   | Ensure that antibiotics listed within the WATCH and RESERVE groups of the AWaRE  list  of  antibiotics,  issued  by  WHO,  are  targeted  by  stewardship  programmes,  at  national and institutional levels.                                                                                                                                       |
| 2.3   | Set and monitor qualitative and quantitative targets for improvement of prescribing  at national level and introduce systems to identify, benchmark and follow up high- end prescribers in community, hospital and veterinary settings.                                                                                                              |
| 2.4   | Introduce  specific  measures  to  improve  antibiotic  prescribing  and  use  in  the  community, hospitals and veterinary practice (including delayed prescribing in the  case of human medicine), and formal systems of access by primary care stakeholders  to specialists in infectious diseases/microbiology for both human and animal health. |
| 2.4.1 | Facilitate  the  use  of  rapid,  point-of-care  diagnostics  to  reduce  the  ambiguity  of  infection management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2.4.2 | Review rules to promote splitting antimicrobial packs in a legal and safe manner, to  reduce the risk of antibiotic left-overs at home.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2.5   | Establish programmes of clinical audits and peer reviews on antibiotic prescribing  among doctors and veterinarians, in a blame free culture and with commensurate  incentives for participation.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2.6   | Ensure that any electronic prescribing systems include antimicrobial prescribing and  link to clinical indication, microbiological and consumption data.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 2.7   | Fast track the procurement of new antibiotics, effective against currently resistant  organisms, and ensure their judicious use by gatekeeping through infectious disease  specialists and microbiologists.                                                                                                                                          |
| 2.8   | Review  existing  accreditation  and  quality  assurance  programmes  of  public  and  private  microbiology  laboratories  to  ensure  they  appropriately  support  and  encourage compliance with best practice AMR approaches.                                                                                                                   |
| 2.9   | Develop a system for safe disposal of antibiotics in the community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2.10  | Encourage farmers' cooperatives and other similar associations to explore models  for the provision of farm veterinary services to achieve more cost-effective  economies of scale.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2.11  | Explore the possibility to introduce and incentivise vaccination programmes in  farmed animals, possibly linked to quality schemes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

- 2.12 Ensure proper mechanisms to enhance the prevention of the introduction of pests and to ensure the implementation of good agricultural practices and integrated pest management (IPM), thereby continuing to discourage the use of antibiotics in crop production and plant protection.
- 2.13 Develop and implement strategies to minimize the contamination of plants and plant products with bacteria.

## Objective 3: Surveillance

Strengthen relevant surveillance and feedback systems on antibiotic use and resistance in human and Animal Health as well as the environment.

Coordinated surveillance is essential to understand the magnitude, distribution and impact of resistant organisms and antimicrobial usage, identify emerging resistance and trends, and determine associations between usage and resistance. Such data will inform immediate actions as well as provide evidence to evaluate policies and set priorities.

The areas of priority for action include:

- 3.1 Strengthen reference laboratory capacity (both human and animal) in the country and  increase  access  to  microbiology  support  for  primary  care  and  veterinary services.
- 3.1.1 Establish molecular typing capability for key resistant organisms.
- 3.2 Strengthen surveillance systems of antibiotic resistance, especially in primary care and in veterinary practice.
- 3.3 Focus surveillance on priority organisms and drug-bug combinations most relevant to Human Health (Table 1). Regularly review and update the list in response to the changing incidence of resistant organisms.

| Rationale                             | Species                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Impact in both hospital and community | Enterobacteriaceae (primarily  Escherichia coli  and  Klebsiell a  pneumoniae )   Staphylococcus aureus                  |
| Impact mainly in hospital             | Acinetobacter baumanii  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  Clostridium difficile                                                    |
| Impact mainly in community            | Streptococcus pneumoniae   Salmonella  species   Campylobacter jejuni  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  Neisseria gonorrhoeae |

- 3.4 Establish and implement a nationally representative and coordinated programme for surveillance of antimicrobial usage in hospitals, the community, environment, animal and aquatic medicine and agriculture, in both food and non-food, and aquatic production, including by sector and by antibiotic (broad and narrow).
- 3.4.1 Establish  a  comprehensive  programme  for  at-source  monitoring  of  antimicrobial residues in food animals.
- 3.4.2 Establish  a  comprehensive  programme  for  at-source  monitoring  of  antimicrobial residues in the environment, including soils and irrigation water.
- 3.5 Strengthen  systems  to  feedback  data  on  antimicrobial  resistance  and  antibiotic consumption used in human and animal care and produce an annual AMR report for Malta.
- 3.6 In  primary human care, establish a sentinel AMR surveillance system with timely feedback and trend analysis.
- 3.7 Explore the possibility of enhancing diagnostic services and sensitivity testing for animals.
- 3.8 Re-introduce veterinary post-mortem services for surveillance of notifiable diseases and necessary testing, as appropriate. Increase sampling of antibiotic residues in carcasses, and food as an indicator of abuse of antimicrobials.
- 3.9 Establish  a  sentinel  AMR  surveillance  programme  in  animals  to  capture  data generated from routine tests undertaken by veterinarians, slaughter houses as well as  the  public  health  laboratory.  This  will  allow  a  better  understanding  of  AMR epidemiology  within  animals,  especially  in  areas  not  covered  by  mandatory  EU testing requirements.
- 3.10 Introduce a programme of antibiotic residue testing in meats available for sale in retail outlets (e.g. butchers, supermarkets) including products such as rabbit meat which are not covered in EU testing programmes.

## Objective 4: Infection Prevention and Control

Improve  infection  prevention  and  control  measures  across  Human  Health  and  Animal Health settings to help prevent infections and the spread of antimicrobial resistance.

Malta has been implementing several actions related to IPC including the introduction of dedicated IPC personnel in acute care and rehabilitation hospitals and the introduction of a focal point of IPC expertise in MDH. These actions have led to several success stories of improved processes and outcomes within tertiary care. However, additional actions need to be implemented, particularly in community and environment settings.

## Further priority actions include:

- 4.1 Implement  and  enforce  national  IPC  regulations  that  include  minimum/core infection prevention and control standards for primary, tertiary, rehabilitation and residential settings, and establish plans to monitor and evaluate their effectiveness.
- 4.2 Establish national IPC coordination and oversight including national IPC guidelines and a healthcare associated infection surveillance programme, covering all public and private healthcare entities.
- 4.3 Implement IPC multi-modal  strategies  commensurate  for  all  healthcare  facilities, through  a  properly  functioning  IPC  programme  managed  by  dedicated,  trained professionals with clear structures of administrative responsibility and accountability for its implementation.
- 4.4 Establish structure, process and outcome Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to allow monitoring and evaluation of IPC activities and structures of healthcare facilities at national and institutional level, to ensure uniformity in competence and output.
- 4.5 Designate the control of CRE as a national priority and address it through specific, funded, interventions outlined in a CRE Action Plan for Malta that includes expanded screening and improved intervention protocols.
- 4.6 Establish specific programmes of Infection Prevention and Control in the community, including follow-up of discharged patients colonised with MDROs and support to primary care physicians.
- 4.6 Improve  hygiene  standards  in  farms  to  prevent  cross-transmission  of  animal pathogens.

## Objective 5: Training, Continuous Professional Development and Education

Through  education  and  training,  increase  awareness  and  understanding  of  AMR,  its implications, and actions to combat it.

Education of all stakeholders involved in combatting AMR is a critical component of any Strategy. Unless all the players are aware of the problem, and the solutions available, it will be impossible to achieve urgency - the first and essential component of behaviour change.

The following actions will be implemented:

- 5.1 Enhance the knowledge and awareness on AMR among healthcare and veterinary professionals  by  ensuring  the  availability  of  continuing  professional  education activities, on AMR and prudent use of antibiotics, not sponsored by industry.
- 5.1.1 Include a minimum of one continued medical education (CME) session on antibiotic use per year as part of any reaccreditation schemes for all those professionals who

prescribe and dispense antibiotics, with an emphasis on multidisciplinary events to enhance inter-professional communication and improved outcomes.

- 5.1.2 Facilitate  educational  activities  on  AMR  and  antibiotic  use  for  other  professions including nursing and allied health.
- 5.2 Review  professional  training  during  undergraduate  and  postgraduate  medical training and programmes.
- 5.2.1 Ensure inclusion of AMR, prudent antibiotic use and infection prevention and control as a defined contact time during undergraduate courses for healthcare professionals, with particular attention to avoiding fragmentation or inconsistencies through improved inter-linking or centralised modules.
- 5.2.2 Include  AMR  training  in  all  post-graduate  training  and  continuing  professional development of specialists.
- 5.3 Provide  health  and  veterinary  professionals  with  communication  resources  and behaviour change training to support informed decision-making regarding treatment and to support efforts to educate clients regarding appropriate antibiotic use  and  effective  infection  prevention  and  control  practices  each  time  they prescribe, dispense or provide advice about antibiotics.
- 5.4 Explore the establishment of academic detailing systems to enhance knowledge of evidence based antibiotic prescribing amongst doctors and veterinarians.
- 5.5 Undertake specific awareness and education campaigns to veterinarians, including safe  disposal  of  waste  generated  by  veterinary  practice,  appropriate  use  of disinfectants in clinics and infection prevention and control measures.
- 5.6 Address  literacy,  on  AMR  and  correct  antibiotic  use  among  both  the  public  and journalists by developing and implementing regular campaigns making full use of conventional and social media platforms.
- 5.7 Set up a help-line dedicated to infections and antibiotic use, manned by appropriate healthcare professionals, to allow the public to phone and discuss basic issues so as to provide reassurance and support.
- 5.8 Educate  employers  on  the  cost-effectiveness  of  adequate  home  rest  in  mild infections, so as to avoid cross transmission in the work place.
- 5.9 Expand educational Animal Health campaigns aimed specifically at farmers, animal and  pet  owners  emphasising  the  risks  of  non-prescribed  use  of  antibiotics  or acquisition of antibiotics from unlicensed sources as well as the benefits and costeffectiveness of greater hygiene.
- 5.10 Include topics on AMR, hygiene and antibiotic use in the curricula of primary and secondary schools to ensure children are educated about the problem from an early age.

## Objective 6: Research and Performance Measurement

Strengthen the research agenda through consensus, coordination and collaboration.

Research initiatives are essential to strengthen the knowledge and evidence base of AMR. In addition, research can provide the basis for devising and implementing more effective interventions to address AMR. It is therefore of great importance that research is actively promoted and supported.

The following will be priority areas:

- 6.1 Agree on a national research agenda to address issues related to AMR.
- 6.2 Develop  local  research  into  the  behavioural  drivers  of  AMR  that  impact  local practices.
- 6.3 Coordinate national AMR research activities and the sharing of information.
- 6.4 Explore and identify opportunities to increase support for research and development, including possible funding sources.

## Objective 7: International partnerships and collaboration

Strengthen international partnerships and collaboration on regional, European and global efforts to respond to antimicrobial resistance.

The increasing movement of people, animals, foods and other products has the potential to facilitate the movement of resistant pathogens across borders faster and further than ever before.  Growth  in  tourism,  including  the  travel  of  people  to  another  country  to  obtain medical treatment in that country, has accelerated the international spread of AMR,   further highlighting the global nature of the problem.

Malta's AMR Strategy will be less effective if it is not aligned with international efforts. To support global efforts to reduce the spread of resistant organisms, Malta must continue to actively collaborate with European countries, especially those in the Mediterranean as well as  international  organisations  through  strategic  policy  support,  regulatory  action  and coordinated initiatives.

## Priority will be given to:

- 7.1 Continue to actively engage with European and International Fora.
- 7.2. Participate in international surveillance initiatives.

## 8. WAY FORWARD

The Strategy supports a collaborative effort through a One Health Approach to enhance those practices that encourage the appropriate and prudent use of antibiotics, change those practices  that  have  contributed  to  the  development  of  resistance  and  implement  new initiatives to  reduce  inappropriate antibiotic usage and resistance. It builds on the good practices  already  being  implemented  by  integrating  new  and  existing  programmes  and initiatives into a unified national response.

Implementation of the priority areas identified will take a staged approach over the life of the Strategy. It will involve many stakeholders and require a high level of cross sectoral cooperation  at  both  the  national  and  international  levels.  The  Strategy  can  only  be successful if all stakeholders heed its call to action and actively look for opportunities to develop new whilst strengthen existing partnerships to support the achievement of the Strategy's objectives.

The Strategy will be regularly reviewed and updated so that it remains reflective of the work that is underway, and action plans for the future.

## APPENDIX 1: LOCAL AMR EPIDEMIOLOGY

## 1. Human Health

Malta is not immune from the significant challenges from AMR that all countries are facing, which - unless effectively addressed - will have significant patient safety consequences. In common with most Mediterranean countries, several drug-bug resistance combinations are locally prevalent in greater proportions than other EU regions, especially Scandinavia, that tend to report low resistance. Furthermore, these local challenges manifest themselves in both hospital as well as community settings.

## 1.1 Hospital

## Staphylococcus aureus

For  over  a  decade,  since  its  initial  participation  in  EARSS  and  now  EARS-Net,  Malta  has reported one of the highest prevalence of MRSA in Europe. Indeed, the proportion of MRSA, isolated from blood cultures was, for many years, greater than 50% as can be seen in Fig 1 below.

Fig 1 Proportion of MRSA in Staphylococcus aureus isolated from blood cultures within European countries participating in the EARS-Net network (source: ECDC 2015)

<!-- image -->

However, over the past years, a significant improvement in MRSA bacteraemia incidence has been achieved in MDH, following the launch of a hospital wide AMR Strategy in 2010. The  cornerstone  of  the  initiative  was  a  policy  of  Root  Cause  Analysis  and  subsequent corrective  action.  As  a  result,  the  median  yearly  incidence  of  MRSA  bacteraemia  has reduced by more than 70% since the start of the campaign (Fig 2).

Fig 2: Incidence of healthcare associated MRSA in Mater Dei Hospital (source: Infection Control Department 2018)

<!-- image -->

## Clostridium difficile

Clostridium  difficile is  traditionally  regarded,  as  only  secondary  to  MRSA  in  terms  of healthcare  transmission  importance.  Nevertheless,  for  as  yet  unknown  reasons,  the incidence  of C.  difficile in  Malta  has  historically  been  significantly  lower  than  most  of European countries, despite a high level of antibiotic use.

## Acinetobacter baumannii

Multi-resistant Acinetobacter  baumannii is highly  prevalent  in  many  Mediterranean countries, especially in the Balkans. This organism was also regularly isolated from patients in  the  Intensive Therapy Unit (ITU) of St. Luke's Hospital, where several outbreaks were reported. However, since the migration to MDH and as a direct consequence of numerous initiatives within this department to improve infection prevention and control practices, incidence of MDR A. baumannii has reduced significantly.

## Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae

Carbapenem-resistant  Enterobacteriaceae  (CRE),  especially Klebsiella  pneumoniae ,  have been reported in several European hospitals. In Malta, the local threat from these organisms is  higher than that reported in most EU countries. Indeed, Malta is one of only three EU countries  that  are  regarded  as  endemic  for  CRE.  In  addition,  New  Delhi  Metallo  beta-

lactamase producing (NDM-1) strains of CRE, almost resistant to all antibiotics, are locally increasing in incidence; at least one outbreak has been reported.

CRE infections have, almost certainly, become Malta's greatest AMR threat.  In fact, the high prevalence  has  led  to  the  CRE  situation  in  Malta  being  referred  to  as  endemic  (Fig  3). Extensive Drug Resistant (XDR) strains are increasing on a yearly basis and Pandrug resistant (PDR) isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae - resistant to all known antibiotics - have started to be detected.  The extent of resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae is demonstrated in Figs 4 and 5 below.

## 1.2 COMMUNITY

## Staphylococcus aureus

Incidence of MRSA in the community setting has reached worrying levels. Approximately 30% of S. aureus isolates from samples sent from health centres are meticillin resistant. A study  looking  at  MRSA  carriage  rate  amongst  healthy  individuals,  without  any  hospital treatment in the previous year, found carriage to be above 8%; this is one of the highest recorded levels in the literature. Misuse and overuse of antibiotics in the community are thought to be responsible for such high MRSA levels, including abuse of topical antibiotics.

## Escherichia coli

Community  strains  of E.  coli exhibit  high  resistance  levels  to  ciprofloxacin;  substantial proportions also exhibit evidence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production. Antibiotic misuse and overuse is thought to be the major driver behind such trends and an association has been shown between E. coli resistance and the consumption of beta-lactam antibiotics and quinolones in the community.

## Streptococcus pneumoniae

Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most important community pathogen causing lower and upper respiratory tract infections. Although it remains relatively sensitive to penicillin, local resistance to macrolides is a concern.

## 1.3 Antibiotic consumption

The current knowledge base on trends and levels of use of antimicrobial agents suggests that major challenges are present in the community. Nevertheless, non-prescribed use of antibiotics has reduced drastically from more than 18% in 2002 to around 1%, as reported by the 2016 Eurobarometer survey. However, the same cannot be said for inappropriate prescribing.  Almost  half  of  the  Maltese  participants  in  the  same  survey  reported  being

prescribed at least one antibiotic during 2015 as seen in Fig 6 below; more worryingly, the vast  majority  of  them  said  that  it  had  been  prescribed  for  a  cold,  flu  or  sore  throat  conditions for which antibiotics are not normally indicated. The vast majority of antibiotics prescribed in the community are broad spectrum in nature; co-amoxiclav, cefuroxime and ciprofloxacin are the three most common; these are greater drivers of resistance than their narrower spectrum equivalents.

Fig 6: Proportion of EU citizens who took at least one oral antibiotic (in tablet, powder or syrup form) from April 2015 to March 2016 (source: Special Eurobarometer 445)

<!-- image -->

Trends of antibiotic consumption within MDH have stabilized in recent years, especially in high consuming units such as intensive care, nephrology and haematology, where antibiotic stewardship  programmes  have  been  successfully  introduced.  Nevertheless,  Fig  7  clearly shows that use per capita is well above the European average. Additionally, the over-use of broad-spectrum  products  (especially  carbapenems)  remains  a  challenge  together  with excessively prolonged and unnecessary use of antibiotics for surgical prophylaxis.

## 1.4 Healthcare associated infections

Data about the prevalence of HAI is mainly available only for MDH, the sole tertiary care hospital that provides the bulk of hospital care in the country (&gt;90%). Results from the 20112012 European Point Prevalence Survey (PPS), undertaken by ECDC, placed the prevalence of HAI in Maltese hospitals at the lower half of the European median (Fig 8); the actual prevalence was lower than what could be predicted from patient characteristics and case mix.  In addition,  significant improvement  has  been  registered  in  the  incidence  of bloodstream infections in intensive care as well as several types of surgical site infections, especially those related to prosthetic hip and knee replacement surgery.

## 2. Animal Health

## 2.1 AMR Epidemiology

Information on AMR in isolates of animal origin remains extremely sparse and restricted to a limited set of isolates tested annually at the National Veterinary Laboratory in compliance with Commission Implementing Decision 652/2013 (EU).  In 2017 samples were collected from fattening pigs and analysed for Salmonella spp., Commensal Indicator Escherichia coli and for ESBL-,  AmpC-  or  Carbapenemase  producing  Escherichia  coli.  17  Salmonella  spp. were isolated from 186 swine carcasses tested. 74 Escherichia coli isolates were cultured from 74 caecal samples collected at the slaughterhouse. 20 isolates of presumptive ESBL-, AmpC- and Carbapenemase- producing Escherichia coli were isolated from the initial 112 swine caecal samples tested. These isolates were then tested for antimicrobial resistance against a panel of antimicrobial substances as prescribed by Decision 652/2013.

Isolates  showing  resistance  to  cefotaxime,  ceftazidime  or  meropenem  are  then  further submitted  to  extended  susceptibility  testing  against  another  panel  of  antimicrobial substances as detailed. Following the results obtained against the first panel of antimicrobial substances, all ESBL-, AmpC- and Carbapenemase- producing Escherichia coli were further submitted to extended susceptibility testing.

There  are  currently  no  laboratories  in  Malta  that  can  provide  a  suitable  service  for performing routine diagnostic and susceptibility tests. As a result, samples must be sent to other countries for analysis but this is rarely done due to the costs, logistical issues (e.g. ensuring suitable conditions for sample transport) and time taken to receive the result.

Malta  is  not  currently  carrying  out  testing  under  Commission  Implementing  Decision 2015/495/EU 6 of 20 March 2015 establishing a watch list of substances for Union-wide monitoring in the field of water policy pursuant to Directive 2008/105/EC of the European

Parliament  and  of  the  Council.  No  other  activities  are  underway  which  could  address environmental aspects of AMR.

## APPENDIX 2: CURRENT STRENGTHS AND DEFICITS IN ADDRESSING AMR IN MALTA

## 1 Legislation and infrastructure

## Current strengths:

- · Presence of an ICM in the form of the NAC.
- · Impact of previous initiatives aimed at over-the-counter (OTC) and public awareness, albeit on a limited scale.

## Current deficits:

- · Absence of a budget inhibits effective planning of NAC initiatives.
- · Limited consultation / involvement of professional associations/stakeholders expected to implement parts of the action plan.
- · The personal capacity of NAC membership could result in limited involvement of professional associations and other stakeholders.
- · Lack of appointed administrative support reduces the execution of NAC activities and  functions,  since  the  voluntary  NAC  members  already  have  other  major commitments.
- · Lack of effective legislation, especially setting minimum IPC standards for hospitals and nursing homes.
- · Absence  of  appropriate  legislation  in  Animal  Health  that  provides  the  necessary tools for effective intervention and regulation, especially in food animal husbandry.
- · Ubiquitous  definitions  of  prescription-only  medicine  for  antibiotics  which  are neither used for treatment of humans nor used in animals and their food.
- · Insufficient tools to ensure  enforcement  of  'prescription-only'  dispensing  of antimicrobials for veterinary use.

## 2. Antibiotic stewardship

## Current strengths:

- · A dedicated pool of specialists in antibiotic management.
- · Strong  antibiotic  stewardship  programmes  (including  guideline  development)  in hospital care, especially at MDH.

## Current deficits:

- · Evidence of inappropriate prescribing in the community for primarily viral infections such as colds, flu and sore throat.
- · Unnecessary prescribing of broad spectrum formulations in ambulatory care, partly as  a  result  of  unavailability  of  older  narrow  spectrum  antibiotics  in  private pharmacies.
- · Excessive reliance on 'last-resort' antibiotics at hospital level, especially carbapenems and glycopeptides.
- · Major challenges in veterinary practice with anecdotal evidence of acquisition of antibiotics from unlicensed sources and direct medication of animals by farmers.

## 3. Surveillance

## Current strengths:

- · Extensive surveillance data on antimicrobial resistance in governmental hospitals.
- · Robust antibiotic consumption data for MDH, the main hospital in the country.
- · Audited IPC outcome and process indicators for MDH, including trends of incidence of multi-resistant organisms such as MRSA and CRE, and hand hygiene compliance, such as use of alcohol hand rub.

## Current deficits:

- · Surveillance of AMR in community infections and residential care is weak; available data invariably originates from samples taken from infections after lack of response to primary treatment, resulting in a bias towards resistance.
- · Data  on  antibiotic  consumption  is  restricted  to  global  wholesaler  statistics.  The predominance of the private nature of general practice coupled with the lack of electronic  prescribing  and  electronic  dispensing  records  makes  it  impossible  to identify and address doctors who prescribe significantly more antibiotics than their peers.
- · Absence  of  e-prescribing  systems  in  both  community,  hospital  and  veterinary settings makes it impossible to study consumption at patient and diagnosis level.
- · There  are  major  lacunae  in  veterinary  practice,  where  information  on  AMR prevalence and antibiotic use is sub-optimal.
- · Feedback of surveillance data to users, especially to community practitioners, is suboptimal.

## 4. Infection Prevention and Control

## Current strengths:

- · Presence of dedicated Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) personnel in acute care and rehabilitation hospitals.
- · Focal point of IPC expertise in MDH.
- · Several success stories of improved processes and outcomes, especially at tertiary care.

## Current deficits:

- · Considerable  heterogeneity  in  IPC  activities  among  acute  care  and  rehabilitation hospitals.
- · Lack of national standardisation, coordination and oversight.
- · Sub-optimal ownership and accountability structures to support implementation.

## 5. Training, Continuous Professional Development and Education

## Current strengths:

- · Coverage of IPC and antibiotic stewardship in some undergraduate courses.
- · Past NAC experience in organising activities for European Antibiotic Awareness Day.
- · Successful interventions to reduce over-the-counter acquisition of antibiotics.

## Current deficits:

- · Low level of knowledge about antibiotics among the public.
- · Lack of appointed administrative support reduces the execution of NAC activities.
- · Inadequate inclusion of AMR in post graduate training.

## 6. Research and Performance Measurement

## Current strengths:

- · Interest in under and postgraduate students to undertake dissertations and audits on AMR related topics.
- · Experienced and enthusiastic researchers, willing to dedicate time over and above clinical duties.

## Current deficits:

- · Economies of scale make large research projects difficult.
- · Budgetary constraints even for smaller research projects.
- · Lack  of  infrastructure  and  paucity  of  dedicated  research  personnel  for  AMR research.

## 7. International partnerships and collaboration

## Current strengths:

- · Participation in EU networks has provided opportunities to network with peers and to learn from successful experiences in other countries.

## Current deficits:

- · Lack of focused initiatives with countries in the Mediterranean region who share many of the infrastructural, cultural and logistical challenges that are key factors in driving AMR locally.
