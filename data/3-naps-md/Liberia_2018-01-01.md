## Acknowledgments

The decision of the Ministry of Health (MoH) to develop the Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) National Action Plan (NAP) was conceived following the World Health Organization (WHO) sponsored conference held in Harare, Republic of Zimbabwe in early January 2017.

A  multisectoral  approach  has  been  used  throughout  its  development;  the  NAP  has  been extensively  reviewed  by  colleagues  from  diverse  institutions  and  line  ministries  covering animal, environmental, plant and human health.  The Pharmacy Division of the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL) would hereby like to express its sincere appreciation and gratitude to the Financing Unit at the Ministry of Health, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Liberia Water and Sewage Corporation (LWSC), Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), National AIDS Control Program (NACP) and National Malaria Program.

Partners and institutions who have also significantly contributed include Centers for Disease Control  and  Prevention  (CDC),  Food  and  Agricultural  Organization  of  the  United  Nations (FAO), Mother Pattern College of Health Sciences, and United States Agency for International Development (USAID). A special recognition goes to the World Health Organization (WHO) for providing technical and financial support throughout this process.

Foreword

## Foreword

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a serious threat to public health, growth, and global economic stability; if not contained, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030, such as ending poverty, ending hunger, ensuring healthy lives, and reducing inequality, are unlikely to be achieved. These issues are all central to the Pro-Poor Agenda for Development and Prosperity (PPADP) 2018 - 2022, and hence combating AMR is a national priority for Liberia.

In response to this imminent crisis, the Government of Liberia has developed the National

Action  Plan  (NAP)  for  Antimicrobial  resistance  (AMR)  2018  -  2022,  which  outlines  five strategic objectives:  To improve awareness and understanding of AMR through education and training;



- To strengthen knowledge and evidence base through surveillance;





- To  reduce  the  incidence  of  infection  through  effective  sanitation,  hygiene  and
- infection prevention measures; To optimize the use of antimicrobial medicines in human and animal health;



- To ensure sustainable investment through research and development.

This action plan complements existing national plans and guidelines including the Investment

Prevention and Control Guidelines 2018 amongst others. Plan for Building a Resilient Health System 2015 - 2021, the National Action Plan for Health Security 2018 - 2022, National Health Quality Strategy 2017 - 2021 and the National Infection Prevention and Control Guidelines 2018 amongst others.

AMR is a complex systemic issue and needs to be treated as such; it has been incorporated into  the  'One  Health  Coordination  Platform'  which  embraces  multisectoral  collaboration amongst  human  and  animal  health,  agriculture,  finance,  environment  and  well-informed consumers. Using this approach, and with our political engagement I am confident that Liberia will do all in its capacity to contain antimicrobial resistance.

Honorable Chief Dr. Jewel Howard-Taylor

## Glossary of Select Terms

Antibiotic Resistance :  The  ability  of  a  bacterium  to  grow or survive in the presence of an antibiotic at a concentration that is usually sufficient to inhibit or kill bacteria of the same species and that exceeds concentrations achievable in the human / animal. It is a subset of antimicrobial resistance.

Antibiotic : Any of a large group of chemical substances, such as penicillin, having the capacity to inhibit the growth of, or to destroy bacteria and other microorganisms, used chief in the treatment of infectious diseases

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR): Develops when microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites)  no  longer  respond  to  a  drug  to  which  it  was  originally  sensitive  to.  When  the microorganisms become resistant to antimicrobials they are often referred to as 'superbugs'.

Antimicrobial  stewardship: A  multidisciplinary,  systematic  approach  to  optimizing  the appropriate use of all antimicrobials to  improve patient outcome and limit emergence of resistant pathogens whilst ensuring patient safety. Or the use of coordinated interventions to improve and measure the use of antimicrobials by promoting optimal drug regimen, dose, duration and route. The aim is for optimal clinical outcome and to limit selection of resistant strains. A key component of a multi-faceted approach to preventing antimicrobial resistance.

Antimicrobial: An  agent  such  as  a  drug  that  destroys  or  inhibits  the growth  of  a microorganism.

Evidence based medicine: A process of independent and objective decision making based on consideration of objective data with integration of best research evidence (external) with clinical expertise (internal) and patient values.

Governance : Is  the  strengthening  of  organizational  structures  for  appropriate  decision making, authority and oversight

Healthcare  associated  infection  (also  referred  to  as  'nosocomial  or  'hospital  acquired infection'): An infection occurring in a patient during the process of care in a hospital or other health  care  facilities,  which  was  not  present  or  incubating  at  the  time  of  admission. Healthcare-associated infections can also appear after discharge.

Infection  prevention  and  control: Infection  prevention  and  control  (IPC)  is  a  practical, evidence-based approach which prevents patients and health workers from being harmed by avoidable infections .

One Health: Coordinated, collaborative, multi-disciplinary approach to address health risks that originate at the animal-human-ecosystems interface. The One Health concept recognizes that human health, animal health, and the environment are interdependent and bound to the health of the ecosystems in which they exist.

Surveillance: Ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of data regarding a health-related event for use in public health action to reduce morbidity and mortality and to improve health.

## Executive Summary

This National Action Plan (NAP) on Prevention and Containment of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)  presents  a  situational  analysis  on  AMR  in  Liberia,  describes  the  One  Health Coordination Platform governance system, and defines the objectives, strategic, operational, monitoring and evaluation plan for AMR. It also maps current and required resources for combating AMR.

The  impact  of  AMR  is  particularly  concerning  in  resource  constraint  settings  with  higher burden  of  communicable  diseases,  fragile  healthcare  system,  inadequate  safe  water  and sanitation, limited AMR awareness and capacity, especially related to surveillance.  Liberia is one  of  the  30  high  burden  countries  for  Tuberculosis  (TB);  in  2016,  for  new  TB  cases presenting  an  estimated  2.6%  were  multi-drug  resistant  to  TB  (MDR-TB),  while  18%  of previously  treated  cases  were  MDR-TB.  The  challenge  of  AMR  containment  is  complex, requiring  a  multisectoral  approach  however  until  now  engagement  of  the  animal  and environmental  sectors  has  been  limited.  Other  issues  include  the  widespread  selling counterfeit drugs; a recent Public Health Law amendment  to ensure appropriate antimicrobial  prescription  may  go  some  way  in  addressing  this.  AMR  laboratory  testing capacity is limited however, gradually being scaled up at regional facilities.

To  effectively  address  these  challenges  the  National  Action  Plan  (NAP)  for  AMR  provides guidance  for  key  stakeholders  over  the  period  of  2018  -  2022.  It  complements  existing strategies, plans and guidelines. Proposes areas of action:

-  Improve awareness and understanding of AMR through education and training;
-  Strengthen knowledge and evidence base through surveillance;
-  Reduce the incidence of infection through effective sanitation, hygiene and infection prevention measures;
-  Optimize the use of antimicrobial medicines in human and animal health; and
-  Ensure sustainable investment through research and development.

The  implementation  of  this  NAP  on  AMR  will  be  coordinated  and  overseen  by  the Antimicrobial  Technical  Working  Group  (AMR  TWG)  under  the  One  Health  Coordinating Platform,  which  will  also  monitor  its  progress.  Successful  implementation  relies  on  the government's commitment, line ministries, regulatory bodies, academia, private sector, civil society organizations and the general public.

Within  five  years,  community  health  assistants  (CHAs),  teachers  (including  universities, nursing and medical and primary schools), local authorities including commissioners, will be orientated  on  concepts  of  antimicrobial  resistance  and  interventions.  Pre-and  in-service curriculums across the relevant sectors will incorporate these concepts.

The NAP will expand the availability of laboratory capacities (including laboratory technicians and  equipment),  establish  sentinel  sites  for  laboratory  surveillance  including  healthcare associated infections (HAIs) in all  regions. It will develop systems to ensure a regular and effective monitoring and reporting of antimicrobial resistance patterns across the relevant sectors.

In order to improve the effectiveness of facility infection control measures, County Health and Social Welfare Teams (CHSWTs) shall ensure that facilities have appropriate operational and  technical  capacities  including  equipment,  supplies  and  infrastructure  necessary  for infection prevention and control. District Health Teams shall designate one Environmental Health Technician (EHT) who will be responsible for ensuring efficient implementation of the national SOPs for infection prevention and waste management at all facilities. Each facility will implement Environmental Management and Mitigation Plans (EMMP).

AMR research agenda and economic case for sustainable investment will be developed.

The estimated five (5) year cost for implementation of this plan is USD$29,527,564 million. Resource mapping has identified approximately ten (10) planned or ongoing sources of technical and/or financial support, which will require further elaboration by the Government of Liberia.

## Introduction

## Background

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), the ability of a microorganism (like bacteria, viruses, fungi and some parasites) to stop an antimicrobial (such as antibiotics, antivirals and antimalarials) from working against it (WHO, 2015), is a global public health threat that unless urgently addressed by 2050 will lead to 10 million deaths and a decrease of GDP between 1 - 3.5% per annum. 1  In Liberia, despite lack of data on AMR, the lack of control on selling of antimicrobials, the common practice of buying counterfeit drugs from 'drug peddlers,' the unrestrained use of  antibiotics  in  the  agriculture  industry  amongst  other  malpractices,  indicate  that  once monitored resistance to pathogens will be found to be widespread.

In view of these threats, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the Office International des  Epizooties  (OIE)  or  World  Organization  for  Animal  Health,  and  the  World  Health Organization (WHO) adopted the Global Action Plan to combat AMR (GAP-AMR) during the World Health Assembly in May 2015. The GAP-AMR recommended a multi-sectoral approach from a One Health perspective, and sets out five strategic objectives: to improve awareness and understanding of AMR; to strengthen knowledge through surveillance and research; to reduce the incidence of infection; to optimize the use of antimicrobial agents; and to ensure sustainable investment in countering AMR.

The National Action Plan (NAP) for AMR 2018-2022 is the translation of the GAP-AMR, taking into consideration the local context and AMR status. It provides a common framework for action  by  all  stakeholders  from  different  sectors,  including  human  health,  animal  health, agriculture  and  environmental  sectors  together  with  the  civil  society  in  managing  and implementing appropriate AMR control activities, while being part of a collective strategy to meet the overall goal.

## NAP for AMR linkages to existing plans

This first edition of AMR NAP complements existing strategies, plans, guidelines, etc. which make reference to preventing and combating AMR in Liberia (see table 1). At the International Health Regulation (IHR) Joint External Evaluation (JEE) held in September 2016 in Liberia, Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) detection, mitigation and stewardship was highlighted as a key area for improvement. In response to this the One Health Coordination Platform, a multisectoral approach to combating human and zoonotic diseases, established an AMR technical working group (TWG) with the mandate to mobilize the local agenda to combat AMR.

At global level multi-sectoral investment strategies such the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),  WHO-General  Programme  of  Work  (GPW  13,  2018-2023)  and  Universal  Health Coverage (UHC), amongst others highlight the importance of combating AMR.

## Goal and target population

The  goal  of  this  National  Action  Plan  is  to  prevent  and  control  the  spread  of  resistant organisms while  ensuring  continuity  of  successful  treatment  and  prevention  of  infectious diseases with effective, safe  and  quality-assured  antimicrobials.    The  plan  proposes  focus areas  based  on  the  principle  that  AMR  requires  a  multi-sectoral  approach  comprising effective communication,  coordination,  and  collaboration  between  the  different  line ministries, partners, and sectors under the One Health Coordination Platform.

The NAP on AMR targets: the public; ministries; departments and agencies; non-state actors; health  professionals;  veterinarians;  other  relevant  professionals;  professional  associations and regulatory statutory bodies involved in the regulation, importation, distribution, retailing, dispensing, use and  disposal of antimicrobials and  in research into alternatives to antimicrobials.

## Guiding Principles underpinning Liberia's NAP on AMR

- 1. Collaboration. Working  individually  will  yield  some  results  but  real  change  requires collaborative action by all jurisdictions, sector partners and the public to better coordinate and respond to AMR.
- 2. Integrated One Health approach. The adoption of an integrated One Health approach recognizes the interconnectedness between humans, animals, crops and the environment, and coordinates actions of all stakeholders.
- 3. Prevention first . Prevention is the most effective, affordable way to reduce risk or severity of infections.
- 4. Sustainability .  The  implementation  AMR  NAP  will  require  long-term  investment,  for instance  in  surveillance,  operational  research,  laboratories,  human  and  animal  health systems,  competent  regulatory  capacities,  and  professional  education  and  training,  in both the human and animal health sectors.
- 5. Information sharing. A concerted response demands that information and best practices are shared and leveraged across jurisdictions and sectors for a coordinated approach to AMR and AMU.
- 6. Flexibility. Progress  on  the  implementation  of  the  NAP  on  AMR  requires  a  flexible, adaptable, and incremental approach that recognizes that AMR activities and capacities are variable across governments and sectors.
- 7. Measuring success. Common indicators and benchmarks must be developed in order to measure effectiveness of priority actions under the NAP.

## Country Situational and SWOT Analysis

## Bacterial Resistance

Drug  resistance  data  is  limited  in  Liberia,  however  information  on  multi-drug  resistance Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is available.  Liberia is one of the 30 high TB burden countries globally with an incidence of 14 per 100,000 population for 2016;  of concern is TB treatment coverage 2 of less than 50%, and loss to follow-up exceeding 10%, all contributing factors to an estimated 2.6% of new cases presenting as MDR-TB, 18% MR-TB in previously treated cases, with 24% resistant to Rifampicin (Table 2). This gives a rate of MDR-TB of 9.4 per 100,000 population.

## Drug-resistant TB care, 2016

|                                                             | Previously treated cases   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Estimated MDRIRR-TB cases among notified pulmonary TB cases |                            |
| rifampicin resistance                                       | 100%                       |
| Laboratory-confirmed cases                                  | Laboratory-confirmed cases |

## Governance and One Health Coordination Platform

A national multisectoral coordinating group (NMCG) for multi-hazard and zoonotic diseases exists  under  the  One  Health  Steering  Committee  platform;  this  is  headed  by  the  Vice President's  office with  multiple ministries actively contributed  to  the platform  (see Governance section for details). The One Health Technical Committee is buttressed by five technical working groups (TWGs); the TWGs meet on a regular basis and feeds back to the One Health Technical Committee on a quarterly basis.  The AMR focal person leads the AMR TWG (see Figure 1).  It  is  a  strength  that  the  One  Health  Coordination  Platform  has  been established; it benefits from political support, is accountable to the government through its structure, has a secretariat, is supported by technical experts and has dedicated funding.

Figure 1: One Health Coordinating Platform organogram

<!-- image -->

Despite this multisectoral approach, the following key stakeholders are yet to participate: Ministries  of  Education  and  Commerce,  City  Corporation  of  Counties,  private  sector representation  (e.g.  animal  production  and  food  processing  industries,  private  hospitals, veterinary and farmers' associations, pharmaceutical industry, health insurance), regulatory bodies (e.g. LMHRA) and key civil societies (e.g. patient groups, sectoral professional bodies, medical associations).

The animal health sector is challenged by a lack of specific legislation, funding and human resources, to  adequately  support  AMR  activities.  More  awareness  and  advocacy  on  good agricultural practices are needed to improve AMR surveillance and detection among farmers involved  with  food  and  livestock  production.  Regulatory  framework,  enforcement  and monitoring for drugs brought into the country are inadequate and no data on drugs for animal health usage is available.

The first World Antibiotic Awareness Week (WAAW) was celebrated from 13 - 19 November 2017. Prior to that, Liberia Medicines and Health Products Regulatory Authority (LMHRA) held regular public communication programs (through radio programs, billboards, and posters) targeting audiences not to buy medicines in the street; the program was however put on hold in 2016 due to financial constraints.

Currently AMR is no formally included in professional training or education programs with the exception of human health laboratories, and faith based institutions such as Mother Pattern College of Health Sciences.

## GAP 2: Strengthen the knowledge and evidence base through surveillance and research

Liberia enrolled in the Global Antimicrobial Surveillance System (GLASS) in early 2018.

For human health, the following laboratory (microbiology) capacity exists:

- ● NRL is  the  coordination  mechanism  for  all  the  regional  labs  in  Liberia,  including  AMR activities. Culture and Sensitivity (C&amp;S) testing for bacterial pathogens is on-going at NRL, but  TB  Drug  susceptibility  confirmatory  testing  (DST)  is  referred  to  the  supranational reference laboratory in Uganda;
- ● Regional laboratories (Jackson F Doe hospital laboratory, Redemption hospital laboratory) are being validated to commence C&amp;S testing for human specimens;
- ● Capacity for C&amp;S at other facilities including JDJ, JJ Dosen, Tellewoyan Memorial, Bomi Local Government and Phebe hospitals in being established;
- ● An inventory system has been developed to take stock of all materials (media, sera, strains and other consumables) with the aim of knowing which facilities have gaps and ensure availability of materials at facilities;
- ● AMR reporting tool has been developed, with a plan to disseminate this tool to all current and future testing sites.

Lab deficiencies include:

- ● The limited technical capacity where approximately 72% of human resources in the laboratory  are  low  cadre  personnel  (laboratory  assistants  and  laboratory  aids), however, has been a  bottleneck  to  expansion  of  C&amp;S  testing  capacity  to  other laboratories;
- ● Poor infrastructure, inadequate supply chain management for AMR surveillance (i.e. no equipment  maintenance  plan  in  place, limited electricity supply), insufficient budgetary allocation for clinical laboratories by the government, and staff attrition, among others, have further affected decentralization of C&amp;S testing capacity

Surveillance activities have been conducted for Tuberculosis (TB), Malaria (artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT) susceptibility), and HIV Anti-Viral (AV) resistance through Esther Funds France (blood spots were sent to France). There is potential for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) surveillance in some faith based hospitals, as well as potential food borne disease antibiotic susceptibility. There is some capacity for bacteriology analysis of food samples at the National Standards Laboratory in the Ministry of Commerce.

For animal heath, no microbiology laboratory capacity, nor AMR surveillance exist.

## GAP 3: Reduce the incidence of infection through effective sanitation, hygiene, and infection prevention measures

Infection prevention and control (IPC) is one of the areas which has made significant strides since  the  Ebola  outbreak  and  can  be  leveraged  on  by  other  programs  to  learn  from.  IPC programs have been established at national and facility level; an IPC unit embedded within the Quality Management Unit (QMU) at MOH, with a national IPC coordinator. Each County Health Team (CHT) and hospital has a designated IPC focal person. The National IPC guidelines which contain a section on AMR were validated in June 2018.  IPC principles have been applied in  the  design  of  triage  and  isolation  at  designated  health  facilities  (Redemption  hospital). Monitoring  and  evaluation  frameworks  are  available  (e.g.  hand  hygiene  audits,  Joint Integrated Supportive Supervision (JISS)) to ensure adherence to IPC standards. Healthcareassociated infection (HAI) data is being collected at selected hospitals; however, this is not being shared at national level nor integrated into the surveillance system.

IPC measures outside health settings are in progress: promotion of personal hygiene by social mobilization; infection prevention through sex and drugs; water and sanitation; vaccination programs; food chain hygiene practices; and in the environmental sector.

The  animal,  plant,  food  and  environment  sectors  do  not  have  hygiene  and  sanitation programs or training in place. No guidelines are in place advising on animal health, welfare and  production.  Vaccination  in  the  animal  health  sector  for  zoonotic  and  non-zoonotic diseases  ( i.e. Brucellosis,  Tuberculosis,  Anthrax)  are  yet  to  be  done.  The  Department  of Environment and Occupational Health (DEOH) conducts spot  inspections of food handling facilities,  although  not  regularly  and  with  logistic  limitations,  and  actions  are  taken  when issues of concern are raised. There is lack of monitoring and surveillance for IPC in animals, plants and food.

## GAP 4: Optimize the use of antimicrobial agents in human and animal health

The Public Health Law is being amended to include the 'Keep Antibiotics Effective' act. The LMHRA is the national drug regulatory authority for human health, which is non-existent in other sectors. Although animal health follows a similar drug registration process to that of human health, no framework exists to ensure that the procedures are being followed.

Marketing  authorization  for  quality  assurance,  safety  and  effectiveness  exists  for  human health. Through the LMHRA,  mechanisms  for detecting and combating counterfeit

antimicrobial  agents  are  in  place  for  human  health;  however,  LMHRA  is  currently  not operational due to the lack of funding.

An essential medicines list, as well as the National Therapeutic Guidelines exist for human health, are available and widely distributed. The National Medicine Policy 2013 emphasizes the need for accessible, prescribed and rational consumption of medicines, and that products should meet local and international quality standards. A section for antimicrobial agents is lacking. Regulation of industries promotional practices is not available in any of the sectors. In addition, there is no regulatory framework for preservation of new antimicrobial agents and stewardship programs.

## GAP 5: Economic investment for sustainability and innovations

No  AMR  research  agenda  nor  projects  are  in  the  pipeline  for  investment  in  research  to develop new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other preventive interventions.

| Purpose statement: | The purpose of the Antimicrobial Resistance TWG (AMR TWG) is to oversee and to coordinate AMR-related activities  in all relevant sectors to ensure a systematic, comprehensive approach to controlling, monitoring and or containing  the global threat of AMR. The AMR TWG shall be charged with the responsibility to address all AMR-related activities from central to county  levels. The scope shall be broad enough to address all five strategic objectives of the Global Action Plan (GAP) and  National Action Plan (NAP) on AMR, prioritizing activities in a step-wise approach.   Principles:  ● Leadership:  The AMR TWG is expected to lead facilitation and, when appropriate, coordination of a national  response to the threat of AMR. The Ministry of Health (Chief Pharmacist) shall be the chair of the AMR TWG.  His/her role shall be extended to making recommendations and submitting progress reports to national and  global governing bodies, (e.g. UN, WHO, OIE, GLASS and FAO) and providing a platform for program planning and  implementation via established technical implementation mechanisms in the form of Technical Working Groups  (TWGs).   ● Political support : As human health is the ultimate concern of activities to control AMR, MoH shall lead the group. |

Date approved by government:

Date to be reviewed:

- ● Authority to act :  The coordinating group shall have sufficient authority to ensure that its recommendations and plans are implemented.
- ● Accountability : The group shall be accountable to the Technical Committee under the One Health Coordination Platform.
- ● Information sharing: The AMR TWG provides a structure for information-sharing to mutually reinforce activities among sectors with triggering mechanisms-national, county, district, healthcare facility and community levels vice visa.
- ● Facilitation and coordination: The AMR TWG shall facilitate and coordinate efforts to contain and reduce the threat of AMR at national level. The AMR TWG shall build a collaborative, cooperative, supportive environment for sharing knowledge, information and experience. The scope of each participating party shall be defined to avoid overlapping and/or duplication of functions. The AMR TWG shall also oversee the development of the NAP on AMR, and oversee all the activities of the TWGs.
- ● External interactions: Collaboration with external agencies and organizations is essential. The AMR TWG shall collaborate with regional and global bodies.
- ● Internal interactions : The national AMR initiative shall align with disease-specific programs (Human, Animal and Environmental).  As  many  agencies,  sectors  and  programs  have  responsibilities  in  areas  affected  by  AMR,  a guiding principle of the AMR TWG is to find the most appropriate ways to facilitate and provide synergy with new or existing work so that the overall objectives of the programs are achieved. Furthermore, the AMR TWG shall be appropriately integrated and have clearly defined roles and responsibilities in the existing health system, public health and disease-specific programs, animal health and production, the food sector and environmental initiatives. The cross-cutting nature of the AMR shall add value to these systems and programs, not supplant them.

As  noted  from the  above, there  are  limited  resources  which  have  as  yet  not  been  committed.  Cognizance  of  this, the  NAP  on  AMR  is the responsibility of the government and will be funded through the following mechanisms which will be led by the AMR pillar to:

- ● Work  in  collaboration  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Development  Planning  (MFDP)  to  ensure  the  provision  of  funding  for  the implementation of the NAP on AMR.
- ● Lobby for a dedicated budget for the implementation of the NAP on AMR.
- ● Leverage existing, cognate budgets within and across Ministries by consultation and collaboration, e.g. budgets allocated for vaccination, IPC, medicines procurement etc.
- ● Prioritize the NAP on AMR in line Ministries budgets annually.

- ● Undertake domestic resource mobilization. For example, the County governments will provide budgets for the implementation of the NAP within their jurisdictions.
- ● Source  external  funds/grants/loans  from  development  partners,  including  the  UN  agencies,  EU,  Fleming  Fund,  USAID,  CDC,  private pharmaceutical companies on the basis of a comprehensive business plan.

## Monitoring and Evaluation Plan

The goal of the AMR NAP M&amp;E plan is to establish a system that is robust, comprehensive, fully integrated and well-coordinated to guide monitoring of the implementation of the AMR NAP and evaluate impact. The objective of the AMR NAP M&amp;E plan is to provide a framework for tracking progress and demonstrating results of the AMR NAP over the short and medium term. The Monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) plan includes the sub-activities, performance indicators, targets, baselines, data source, frequency of collection and responsible entity (table 15). Monitoring should take place bi-annually and be led by the AMR unit. Evaluation of the implementation of the NAP AMR should take place at half way through the timeframe (last quarter of 2020) and at the end of Year 5 (mid- 2022).
