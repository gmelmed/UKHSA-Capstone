## Foreword

The One Health Master Action Plan (OHMAP) provides guidance on implementing Australia's National Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy - 2020 and Beyond (the 2020 Strategy).

In March 2020, the Australian Government released the 2020 Strategy to combat the threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). We use antimicrobials such as antibiotics to prevent and treat infections caused by microorganisms. But the more we use antimicrobials, the less effective they become because microorganisms can adapt through genetic changes. This is known as antimicrobial resistance. The inappropriate use of antimicrobials in Australia and worldwide is making the problem worse.

This means some infections caused by resistant microorganisms have become harder and, in some cases, almost impossible to prevent and treat. This includes some common gastrointestinal, skin and urinary tract infections.

Antimicrobials are a valuable shared resource and we need to ensure they remain effective at protecting the health of humans, animals and the environment for decades to come.

Building on Australia's First National Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy 2015-19 , the 2020 Strategy represents Australia's continued commitment to:

minimise the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance and ensure the continued availability of effective antimicrobials.

To achieve this goal, the 2020 Strategy focuses on seven Objectives divided into Priority Areas for Action. They highlight where we must focus our efforts. This includes implementation partners developing 'short- to medium-term action plans' to show when and what they will do to tackle AMR.

The OHMAP assists by highlighting activities to focus on, informed by the expert advice of the Australian Strategic and Technical Advisory Group on Antimicrobial Resistance.

This means implementation partners can refer to the OHMAP for expert and current guidance when developing their action plans.

As Australia builds on its successes, the 2020 Strategy and OHMAP emphasise the importance of tackling AMR through a One Health approach. This means working in a collaborative and coordinated manner across all levels of government and sectors.

By implementing a One Health approach with the OHMAP guiding the way, Australia can minimise the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance and ensure the continued availability of effective antimicrobials.

## THE 2020 STRATEGY FOCUSES ON 7 OBJECTIVES.

- 1 Clear governance for antimicrobial resistance initiatives
- 2 Prevention and control of infections and the spread of resistance
- 3 Greater engagement in the combat against resistance
- 4 Appropriate usage and stewardship practices
- 5 Integrated surveillance and response to resistance and usage
- 6 A strong collaborative research agenda across all sectors
- 7 Strengthen global collaboration and partnerships

This will help achieve a healthier future for Australians.

## Glossary

Agriculture sector: The agriculture sector relates to plants and crops cultivated and harvested as food or feed. For the purpose of this document it excludes animal production (see 'animal sector').

Animal sector : The animal sector includes terrestrial and aquatic food- and fibre-producing animals, companion animals (including performance animals), zoological collections, laboratory animals and wildlife treated with antimicrobials.

Antimicrobial: An active agent such as medicine that, on application to living tissues or through systemic use, kills, prevents or inhibits the growth of microorganisms. Antimicrobials include antibiotics, antiseptics, antifungals, antivirals, antimalarials and anthelmintics.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) : The ability of microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and viruses to develop a capability to grow or survive in the presence of antimicrobials, and to pass this trait on via their genes to other microorganisms.

Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) : The safe and appropriate use of antimicrobials to reduce harm while also curtailing the incidence of antimicrobial resistance.

Biosecurity : Efforts to prevent, respond to and recover from pests and diseases that threaten the economy and environment.

Environment sector : The environment sector covers all terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and the native and introduced species present in those ecosystems including vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, fungi, macro and microorganisms. The environment sector does not include animals or plants covered by the animal and agriculture sectors, respectively.

Food sector : The food sector includes all those enterprises and premises engaged in food production, processing, food preparation, food service and retail of food commodities.

Infection prevention and control (IPC ): Any practice to prevent and/or stop the occurrence of diseasecausing microorganisms in human and animal clinical, preventive health and community settings.

One Health: The principle of applying a collaborative and coordinated effort across multiple sectorsworking locally, nationally and globally-to attain optimal health for people, animals and the environment.

Priority populations : Specific groups of Australians who should receive priority consideration depending on circumstances.

Sector: In this report, 'sector' refers to the agriculture, animal health, environment, food and human health sectors to which a One Health approach will be applied.

Society : In this report, 'society' is an inclusive term referring to all Australians, whether in the general public or in other groupings.
