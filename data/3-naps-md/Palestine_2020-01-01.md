## Foreword

Palestine has always accorded top priority to the health of its citizens.  National Policy Agenda (2017-2022) accords priority to health of its citizens and this commitment is articulated under the National Priority 9: Quality Health Care for All. The National Health  Strategy  (2017-2022)  further  elaborates  the  direction  that  the  Palestinian government  is  pursuing  in  providing  quality  health  care  services  to  its  entire population in true spirit of Universal Health Coverage.

Sustained efforts in recent past, and with investment of substantial resources, it has been  possible  to  significantly  reduce  the  infant  mortality  and  maternal  mortality. Unlike many other developing countries, infectious diseases do not contribute to huge mortality  and  morbidity  in  Palestine.  Less  than  2.5%  of  all  deaths  in  a  year  is attributed  to  infectious  diseases.  This  has  been  possible  with  high  coverage  of immunization  and  efficient  patient  care.  These  successes  are  however  at  risk  now. Emergence  and  spread  of  resistance  in  many  bacteria  of  medical  importance  to commonly used and affordable antibiotics is threatening achievements of Palestine as well as rest of the world in containing infectious diseases.

This  antimicrobial  resistance  (AMR)  is  rightly  recognized  as  the  greatest  challenge being faced by the humankind in its battle against infectious diseases. A widely read report  that  was  commissioned  by  the  Prime  Minister  of  the  United  Kingdom  has projected  that  if  no  action  is  initiated  now,  the  mortality  due  to  antibiotic  resistant bacteria by 2050 shall exceed 10 million per year. Most of these deaths and patients with  infectious  diseases  shall  be  from  developing  world  with  limited  resources  to manage these.

The  impact  of  AMR  is  not  limited  to  human  and  animal  health.  Huge  economic implications adversely affecting the human development and global economic growth In  response  to  a  call  by  the  global  community  and  through  extensive  consensus process,  WHO,  FAO  and  OIE  developed  a  Global  Action  Plan  to  combat  AMR  in 2015. The United Nations General Assembly in its special meeting in 2016 discussed

this burgeoning challenge and called upon all countries to develop; and implement their respective   National Action Plans with comprehensive One Health   approach where human health; animal health and environment sectors work   together   in a coordinated way to prevent emergence of AMR and its spread.

It gives me immense satisfaction to note that to undertake this task; Palestine  has developed its National Action Plan for AMR for next five years. Though the national action plan is aligned with the WHO Global Action Plan; it has been formulated in context  of Palestine with very practical and doable   activities the available human resource and the infrastructure available within the country. The action plan has been developed through a multisectoral\_ multidisciplinary inter-ministerial collaborative efforts by large of national experts. using and

I endorse this national action plan and assure all support for its speedy and efficient implementation in Palestine.

## Preface

Of late, the antibiotics which have saved millions of lives in past seven decades are slowly and steadily becoming ineffective. Most of the infectious diseases have ceased to  respond  to  common  and  affordable  antibiotics.  The  common  pathogens,  in  their quest for survival and propagation, have developed variety of mechanisms to thwart the  action  of  antibiotics.  The  continuous  irrational  use  of  antibiotics  has  facilitated selection  and  propagation  of  these  resistance  pathogens.  We  are  surely  and  swiftly moving to an era where even minor infections shall have the potential to be fatal.

Unlike  numerous  other  medicines,  the  pipeline  for  the  discovery,  development  and dissemination of new antibiotics is virtually dried out. No new class of antibiotics has been  discovered  in  past  three  decades.  The  reason  is  simple.  Availability  of  a  new antibiotic takes (10 - 12 years) and almost an investment of 1 billion USD. Once it comes into the market, its indiscriminate use swiftly results into resistance, rendering it useless.  Hence,  the  pharmaceutical  industry  is  not  keen  to  invest  into  these discoveries.

The growing problem of AMR has been a manmade disaster. Use of antibiotics has been irresponsible, irrational, and abusive in all sectors - human health, animal health, fisheries, agriculture etc. Unfortunately, this behaviour remains unstoppable leading to widespread  antimicrobial  resistance  or  AMR.  Extensive  use  of  antibiotics  is  the greatest  driver  for  emergence  of  AMR.  While  in  humans,  antibiotics  are  primarily used  for  treating  sick  patients,  in  animal  antibiotics  are  extensively  used  as  growth promoters and as economical replacement of essential sanitary environment.

Only  recently,  AMR  has  been  recognized  as  an  important  global  public  health challenge with serious impact on global economy and development. Various political and economic fora have deliberated on this emerging phenomenon and given a call for a  coordinated  One  Health  approach  to  combat  AMR  worldwide.    The  Sustainable Development Goals or SDGs have also articulated importance of containing AMR in its  political  declaration.  Similar  articulations  have  been  made  by  (G7,  G20,  EU, ASEAN) and other such economic and political platforms.

Inter  country  development  agencies  led  by  the  WHO,  FAO  and  the  World  OIE developed Global Action Plan on AMR and requested all Member States to formulate GAP-aligned respective National Action Plans for AMR by May 2017.

Following  guidance  of  FAO,  OIE  and  WHO,  Palestine  through  an  extensive countrywide  consultative  process  during  2019,  developed  its  National  Action  Plan. Palestine national action plan is based on the One Health approach, which means that human health, animal health as well as environment sectors have equal responsibilities and strategic actions.

Implementation of  Palestinian   NAP needs to be accelerated. This   plan aims to augment capacity of all stakeholders for all dimensions of AMR including regulatory mechanisms; infection control practices and diagnostics support; availability and use of appropriate   guidelines   for therapy; biosecurity in animal  rearing   practices   and active engagement of communities. These are challenging tasks. However, with health already high on national agenda; with our concerted efforts we shall be able to reduce the impact of AMR on human health in Palestine.

## Executive Summary

Antimicrobial agents (commonly known as antibiotics) have and continue to play a critical role in the treatment of infectious diseases. These are essential to protect both human and animal health. Antibiotics are also mandatory for successful use of modern medical interventions and complex surgeries. Unfortunately, prolonged abuse of these drugs  in  human  health,  the  livestock  sector,  and  poor ecological management  of antibiotic  residues,  has  led  to  the  emergence  and  spread  of  antimicrobial  resistance (AMR) in microorganisms (primarily bacterial pathogens) making several antibiotics ineffective. If AMR is not urgently countered, the world is likely to slide into a 'postantibiotic  era',  where  even  minor  infections  may  prove  fatal  and  modern  complex surgeries redundant because of poor outcomes.

AMR  is  no  longer  a  human  health  issue.  It  has  a  grave  potential  to  damage  the national  and  global  economy,  food  security  and  the  health  of  people.  O'Neill  study that was commissioned by the Government of the United Kingdom estimates that as of  now  AMR  annually  kills  about  700,000  people  worldwide  -  a  number  that  is projected to rise to 10 million by 2050 if adequate measures are not initiated now. It also  projects  based  upon  mathematical  models  that  by  2050,  a  global  loss  of  $100 trillion shall be ascribed to AMR. Global GDP is likely to decrease by 3.5% during same period.

AMR has the potential to push people in developing countries into poverty because of high cost of treatment for prolonged period. The World Bank estimates that 28 million people are likely to be pushed into poverty as a direct consequence of AMR. It also projects that livestock production may be reduced by 7.5% throughout the world, thus damaging food security.

Resistant to AMR has thus become a world-wide challenge that has been highlighted in  the  UN  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs).   Accordingly,  there  has  been  a serious  global  political  response  to  threat  of  AMR.  The  UN  General  Assembly,  the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO)  and  the World  Organisation  for  Animal  Health (OIE)  have  recognized  the seriousness of the situation and requested countries for urgent and globally coordinated action against AMR.

In May 2015, the sixty-eighth World Health Assembly (WHA) endorsed the Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (GAP-AMR). The WHA resolution 68.7 has urged Member States to align their National Action Plan on AMR with GAP-AMR by May 2017. Commitment by global leaders to combat AMR was further strengthened at the High-Level Meeting on AMR at the United Nations General Assembly on 21 September 2016.  FAO and OIE have also endorsed similar Resolutions.

AMR is not a patient oriented issue. Resistant pathogens arising in humans, animals, or the environment have the potential to spread from one to the other, and from one

country to another. International travel and trade accelerate the spread of AMR across national  borders.  There  is  frequent  transmission  of  resistant  pathogens  between animals and humans, true zoonosis.

While the emergence of AMR has accelerated, the discovery and development of new classes of antimicrobial medicines have drastically slowed because of the high cost of discovery and development of new molecules and associated low return on investment. It is estimated that it takes up to 10-12 years for a new antibiotic to come to  the  market.  Total  cost  of  development  process  is  estimated  to  be  around  USD  1 billion.

Palestine, like all other developing countries is also struggling with management of infectious  diseases  using  affordable  and  safe  antibiotics.  There  are  several  reports available  in  the  global  literature  in  support  of  prevalence  of  multidrug  resistant pathogens  in  human  and  animal  health  sectors  especially  poultry.  This  challenge needs to be addressed on priority.

The possible solutions to contain AMR requires a comprehensive and integrated One Health approach with coordinated efforts by human health, veterinary and environment sectors through a whole-of-society initiative. Indeed, major roles are to be played by political, financial,  technical,  regulatory,  programmatic,  and  education stakeholders representing both public and private sectors.

With above mentioned background, Palestine has identified five Goals for its National Action Plan (NAP) which are in alignment with the WHO Global Action Plan on AMR (GAP). These are:

- 1. Improve  public  awareness,  understanding  of  antibiotic  use  and  antimicrobial resistance.
- 2. Strengthen national one-health surveillance efforts for antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial use.
- 3. Implement evidence-based infection control practices that can prevent the spread of resistant pathogens.
- 4. Optimize the use of antimicrobial  medicines in  human and animal health sectors and
- 5. Encourage and promote operational research on AMR.

NAP  AMR  is  expected  to  reflect  the  five  principles  based  on  which  GAP  was developed. These include:

- 1. Whole-of-society engagement including a One Health approach,
- 2. Prevention first,
- 3. Access,
- 4. Sustainability, and
- 5. Incremental targets for implementation

## NAP Goal 1

Focuses  on  improving  awareness  and  understanding  of  AMR  through  effective communication, education and training, thus bringing about a change in behaviour of users and prescribers.

## NAP Goal 2

Is  directed  to  establishment  of  a  national  One  Health  surveillance  system  for AMR and  strengthening  laboratory  capacity  for  undertaking  surveillance.  It  also  aims  to track use of antimicrobials and their residues in various locations and develop policies that promote their rational use.

## NAP Goal 3

Attempts to reduce the incidence of infection through effective infection prevention and control in healthcare, in animal health and food chain to reduce spread of AMR.

## NAP Goal 4

Aims to promote rational and optimal use of antibiotics in  various  settings  through strengthening  of  enforcement  of  regulations,  ensuring  access  and  surveillance  of antimicrobial use, antimicrobial stewardship in healthcare as well as animal health.

## NAP Goal 5

Aims to promote operational research (OR)  that supports activities  under  NAP  and make them more efficient and cost-effective.

The Palestinian Operational Plan to implement NAP has identified various activities that  need to be carried out by different sectors in a time bound manner to meet the targets set in this NAP. A monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) Plan for each goal has also been proposed to keep track of the progress made and modifying the operational plan, if needed.

Using an efficient multi-sectoral, multi-disciplinary and multipronged model with One Health approach, as envisaged in this National Action Plan, Palestine aims to combat AMR in near future and thus contribute to welfare of its people and contribute to the global health security.

## Introduction

Antibiotics  that  have  also  been  called  as  magic  bullets  came  into  clinical  use  more than 70  years back. They  revolutionized medicine, transforming often fatal diseases into curable, or at least manageable, problems. So much was the impact of antibiotics on  human  health  that  people  started  using  these  as  solution  to  all  health  problems irrespective  of  evidence  for  use  of  antibiotic  therapy.    This  accelerated  the  survival process in microorganisms too who rapidly developed several defence mechanisms to protect  themselves  from  antibiotics.  The  advantage  accrued  to  them  because  of selection pressure by antibiotics. The more antibiotics were used greater became the resistance.

The  indiscriminate  use  of  antibiotics  in  different  settings  have  given  an  edge  to pathogens.  Most  of  the  infectious  diseases  have  ceased  to  respond  to  common  and affordable  antibiotics.  Unless  checked,  very  soon  minor  infections  shall  have  the potential to be fatal. Complex surgeries such as organ transplantation, cardiac bypass, etc.  shall  be  difficult  to  undertake  because  of  catastrophic  complications  that  may occur after surgery. Food security for burgeoning populations shall also be at risk.

At the same time, the pipeline for the discovery, development and dissemination of new antibiotics is virtually dried out. No new class of antibiotics has been discovered in  past  three  decades.  Availability  of  a  new  antibiotic  takes  (10  -  12  years)  and  an investment of around 1 billion USD. Once new antibiotic comes into the market, its indiscriminate use swiftly results into resistance, rendering it useless and negating any potential return on investment.

Today antimicrobial resistant  [AMR] pathogens are estimated to kill  about  700,000 people  worldwide  every  year.  In  the  absence  of  concerted  global  actions,  the mortality, morbidity and economic loss will swell in next 2-3 decades. The livestock production will decrease due to infections in food producing animals thus influencing food security and affecting most the poor.

Fortunately, during past few years there has been huge global concern and political dialogue on combating AMR. In an unprecedented move in 2016, and next only to HIV, non-communicable diseases and Ebola pandemic, the United Nations General Assembly  deliberated  on  AMR  and  gave  a  call  for  an  urgent  implementation  of global,  coordinated  efforts  adopting  WHO  GAP.  In  its  political  declaration,  UN Sustainable  Development Goals or SDGs have articulated importance of containing AMR.  Powerful  global  and  regional  political  platforms  especially  (G7,  G20,  EU, ASEAN) have also voiced their concern on emerging problem of AMR and its impact on human development and global economy.

Spurred by the global concern, inter country development agencies led by the WHO, FAO and the World OIE developed Global Action Plan on AMR and requested all Member States to formulate GAP-aligned respective National Action Plans for AMR by May 2017.

## Overview of genesis of global action plan

Several  national,  regional  and  global  initiatives  are  engaged  in  tackling  AMR.  In 1998,  the  World  Health  Assembly  (WHA)  of  the  WHO  urged  member  states  to develop suitable measures to tackle AMR. In 2000, WHO called the rise of AMR a global  crisis,  and  in  2001,  it  released  its  first  global  strategy  for  its  containment. However, the real impetus came in 2011 when WHO dedicated the World Health Day theme to antimicrobial resistance.

In 2015, WHO developed Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (GAP) and through WHA resolution 68.7, it called upon all countries to develop their respective National  Action  Plans  (NAP)  in  alignment  with  GAP  before  May  2017.    It  also advocated with the countries that they must use a One Health approach for combating AMR thereby involving animal health and environmental areas also in these global efforts.

GAP was adapted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)  and  the  World  Organization  for  the  Animal  Health  (OIE),  the  international agencies that are engaged with health of animal and agriculture. In September 2016, the United Nations General Assembly came out with a political declaration asking all countries to galvanize their efforts in combating AMR using One Health approach.

Development of national action plan to combat antimicrobial resistance in  Palestine emanates from global efforts as have been reflected in the WHO Global Action Plan for AMR (2015) that provides a broad framework for combating AMR.

## Goal of GAP

To ensure, for as long as possible, continuity of successful treatment and prevention of infectious diseases with effective and safe medicines that are quality-assured, used in a responsible way, and accessible to all who need them.

## Strategic Objectives of GAP

GAP has defined the following five strategic objectives for containment of AMR:

- 1. Improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance.
- 2. Strengthen knowledge through surveillance and research.
- 3. Reduce the incidence of infection.
- 4. Optimize the use of antimicrobial agents; and,
- 5. Develop  economic  case  for  sustainable  investment  based  on  country  needs  and increase investment in new vaccines, diagnostics and other interventions, ( Figure 1 )

FIGURE 1: FIVE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES FOR CONTAINMENT OF AMR

GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF GAP

GAP suggests that all action plans should reflect the following principles:

- 1. Whole-of society engagement including 'One Health' approach.
- 2. Prevention first.
- 3. Access.
- 4. Sustainability.
- 5. Incremental Targets for implementation.

Until December 2019, 73 Member States of the WHO have developed and submitted their  National  Action  Plans  to  WHO.  Palestine  also  has  a  strong  desire  to  join  this group of countries and initiate implementation of the NAP on priority .

## Genesis of National Action Plan in Palestine

In accordance with World Health Organization Resolution WHA 68.7, the Palestinian national authority has decided to develop a national AMR plan that would be aligned with  the  GAP  for  the  use  of  antimicrobial  medicines  in  animal  health,  agriculture, environment and human health.

Accordingly, in 2019 Palestine decided to follow the overall strategy as recommended by WHO and shown in Fig above.

## The Country

The State of Palestine is inhabited  by  4.85  million people (2018)  with 2.92  million people living in the West Bank and 1.93. million in the Gaza Strip. This population lives in an area of 6,220 square kilometres, with a population density of around 795 people per square kilometre. Life expectancy at birth for Palestinians was 73.9 years in  2018.  The  overall  Palestinian  population  is  predominantly  young:  nearly  40%  of Palestinians are aged 0-14 years, and 5% are aged 65 years or older . 1

## Health profile

Palestine,  with  one  of  the  youngest  populations  in  the  Region,  is  experiencing  a demographic  and  epidemiological  transition.  Total  fertility  is  high  but  declining, slowing population growth. Non communicable diseases account for four of the five deaths.

Infant mortality in 2018 reached 11.7 deaths per 1000 live births, and the under-five mortality  rate  reached  13.4  deaths  per  1,000  live  births. This  reflects  a  significant improvement  when  compared  to  death  rates  in  previous  years. The  MoH  (2018 estimated the maternal mortality rate in Palestine to be 16.7 per 100,000 live births.In 2018, 98.4%of all children (aged 12-23 months) received the full set of recommended vaccinations 1 , ( Figure 2 ).

## FIGURE 2: CAUSES OF DEATHS, PALESTINE, 2018.

Non-communicable diseases are predominantly major causes of mortality. According to  Health Annual Report of Ministry of Health top ten causes of reported deaths in

<!-- image -->

2018 were cardiovascular diseases (31.5%), cancer (15.4%), cerebrovascular diseases(13.0%),  prenatal  conditions  (9.5%),  diabetes  mellitus  (7.5%),  respiratory diseases (3.7%),  accidents  (4.0%),  congenital  malformation    (3.5%),  chronic renal  failure  2.9%,  digestive  and  liver  diseases  2.7% infectious  diseases  (0.3%) . Infectious diseases are ranked at No 9 amongst top 10 causes of mortality . 1

## Health services and Infrastructure

There are four main providers of health care services in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip:  Ministry  of  Health,  United  Nations  Relief  and  Works  Agency  (UNRWA), nongovernmental  organizations  and  the  Palestinian  Military  Medical  Services,  each with its own respective network of primary health care centres and hospitals.

The  Palestinian  Ministry  of  Health  (MoH),  UNRWA,  Military  Health  Services, NGOs,  and  the  private  sector  cover  primary,  secondary,  and  tertiary  health  care services. According to the MoH (2017), there are 743 primary health care centers in Palestine (583 in the West Bank and 160 in Gaza).

The Palestinian Ministry of Health is the major provider of primary health care in the West Bank, accounting for more than 70% of the 583 clinics. UNRWA and NGOs operate additional 24 mobile clinics. In the Gaza Strip, the MoH accounts for about one  third  (32%)  of  the  160  primary  health  clinics,  with  a  larger  role  played  by UNRWA  and  nongovernmental  organizations. UNRWA  provides  services for Palestinian refugees in the occupied Palestinian territory, and covers comprehensive primary health services, with limited support for hospital care. In Gaza there are 158 centers,  the  MoH  operates  about  51  primary  health  care  centers  while  UNRWA operates  about  22  centers.  The  majority  of  centers  are  operated  by  NGOs,  privet sectors (80 centers), and the military services operates only five centres . 2

There  are  81  hospitals  in  total  in  the  occupied  Palestinian  territory,  with  51  in  the West Bank and 30 in the Gaza Strip. Bed capacity is approximately 1.3 beds per 1000 of the population. East Jerusalem hospitals are the cornerstone of the tertiary care in the Palestinian health system.

The central preventive medicine unit undertakes data collection and analyses of health -related data. The  Central Public Health Laboratory  is the national reference laboratory for providing laboratory support system.

Gaza reported a shortage of about 170 types of medicine and 267 types of medical disposables 3 .

The  continuing  blockade  and  successive  conflicts  have  influence  the  health  sector capacity in the Gaza Strip. From 2010 to 2016, there has been a 9% reduction in the number of hospital beds, a 5% reduction in nurses, and a 21% reduction in doctors,

per  head  of  the  population.  This  is  a  severe  challenge  to  provide  sustainable  health services to citizens.

## Health Financing

According  to  the  World  Bank  (2012),  public  spending  on  health  is  close  to  5%  of GDP,  exceeding  the  regional  average  of  2.6%  and  the  low-  and  middle-income country average of 1.7% of GDP, and fuelled by relatively high spending on salaries, medical referrals  for  tertiary  care  and  pharmaceuticals.  Public  and  private  spending for health more than tripled from 2000 to 2012, to US$ 1.3 billion, more than 12% of GDP. Per capita total health expenditure more than doubled between 2000 and 2012, from  US$  126  to  US$  294.  Reflecting  high  out-of-pocket  spending,  especially  for pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceutical expenditure is affected by import.

About 82% of the Palestinian population living in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip is covered by some form of prepayment for health care. Around 38% of health financing comes from out-of-pocket payments. Sustainability of its health service provision is a challenge.

The  major  providers  of  health  coverage,  the  Government  Health  Insurance  and UNRWA,  account  for  more  than  90%  of  the  coverage  provided  and  overlap significantly.  The  government  health  insurance  covers  primary  health  care  services including maternal and child health services, secondary health care services, prescription  medicines  on  the  essential  medicines  list,  and  tertiary  care  services needed.

## National Health Initiatives

National  Policy  Agenda (2017-2022)  accords  priority  to  health  of  its  citizens.  It commits through its National Priority 9: Quality Health Care for All better health care services through following policy interventions:

- 1. Reform the public health insurance system.
- 2. Ensure the fiscally sustainability of the health care system.
- 3. Improve the quality of health care services (infrastructure, equipment,  medicines, IT, training of health care workers, standards)
- 4. Increase equitable access to health care services.
- 5. Improving Citizens' Health and Well-Being
- 6. Strengthen preventive health care, raise awareness and promote healthy lifestyles. Introduce a family health care approach. Improve and implement national policies on chronic disease management.

In continuation with National Policy Agenda, Ministry of Health has issued National Health  Strategy (2017  -  2022) with  following  strategic  objectives  that  are  aligned with National Policy Agenda

- 1. Ensure  rights-based,  comprehensive  and  integrated  health  care  services  for  all citizens (taking into consideration gender, age, geographic  distribution and political and socioeconomic equity).
- 2. Promote preventative health care and management of non-communicable diseases.
- 3. Establish an effective, comprehensive and sustainable quality system for all health services.
- 4. Ensure the availability of a qualified health workforce capable of delivering high quality health services
- 5. Enhance institutional, financing and governance mechanism

Universal  Health  Coverage is  high  priority  on  national  agenda.  The  Palestinian Ministry  of  Health  continued  its  coordination  with  local  and  international  partners towards the realization of universal health coverage.

The Palestinian Institute of Public Health is currently finalizing the establishment of the first comprehensive observatory of human resources for health in the occupied Palestinian  territory.  As  a  second  step,  projections  of  needed  specialties  will  be developed as the basis for the first comprehensive health workforce strategy.

A  central  database  is  being  developed  to  provide  computerized  and  up  to  date information  on  matters  such  as  medical  professionals,  patient  medical  records,  and prescription drug use.

## Communicable Diseases in Palestine

Palestine has a successful immunization programme and a well-functioning surveillance system for the control of communicable diseases. Some diseases, such as schistosomiasis, leprosy, rabies and wild poliovirus, were historically eradicated The incidence  of  tuberculosis  is  low,  with  29  cases  reported  in  2015,  or  0.61  per  100 000.21 The national immunization schedule covers tuberculosis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, Haemophilusinfluenzae type B, rotavirus, pneumococcus, measles, mumps and rubella. Immunization coverage is consistently high, ranging from (96% to 99%) since 2013.

## Immunization

Health  service  coverage  and  utilization  are  high,  with  full  coverage  of  DPT3  and measles immunization for 1-year old children in  2015,  universal  antenatal  care  and

skilled  health  workers  at  almost  all  deliveries.  This  is  one  of  the  reasons  for  low incidence of communicable diseases.

## Cooperation with International Development Partners

Several  international  development  partners  including  World  Bank,  WHO,  FAO, UNICEF, Government of Italy, USAID, UNFPA etc. provide financial and technical assistance  to  the  country  in  various  fields  in  health  and  allied  sectors.  WHO  is supporting through its Country Cooperation Strategy. Areas where WHO support has been  available  include  universal  health  coverage;  strengthen  the  country's  core capacities  for  the  International  Health  Regulations,  supporting  quality  and  patient safety  programs,  health  emergency  and  disaster  risk  management,  supporting  the Ministry  of  Health  and  partners  to  develop  a  system  to  monitor  antimicrobial resistance and to develop an action plan to address antimicrobial resistance .

WHO also provides technical assistance to strengthen the national capacity to prevent, manage and control non-communicable diseases and improve the social determinants of health.

## Pharmaceutical regulatory agency

Antibiotics  have  been  categorized  as  essential  medicines  and  constitute  57  of  total drugs in the essential drug list (EDL) constituting almost 10% of EDL. The General Directorate of Pharmacy through its seven departments ensures that effective and safe medicines of good quality are affordable, available and rationally  used, through the application of regulations and instructions of the Ministry of Health.

Antibiotics are available only on prescription. One of the prerequisites for registering antibiotics at the Ministry of Health (MoH) is that the label on the antibiotics must clearly mention that this product is available only by prescription ("prescription only" Rx).

The  Ministry  of  Health  has  issued  a  circular  to  all  doctors  and  pharmacists  in  all health centers in Palestine, to comply with the following instructions:

-  Antibiotics should not be dispensed without a prescription under legal accountability especially in the private sector.
-  Doctors should not prescribe unnecessary antibiotics to patients, especially in diseases caused by viruses such as influenza, flu, colds, congestion and others.

MoH has approved an OTC list of medicines that can be sold by the pharmacist to the patient without a prescription. Antibiotics have  been  excluded  from  this list. Moreover, Antibiotics are not allowed to be promoted by pharmaceutical companies

through the media. According to MoH Medicines Promotion instructions, 'that allows promotion -for OTC drugs only.

## Animal health sector in Palestine

Livestock  production  is  an  integral  part  of  Palestinian  agricultural  sector,  and  is  of economic  and  social  importance  both  at  the  household  and  national  levels.  Cattle, poultry,  sheep,  goats,  beekeeping  and  fishes  dominate  livestock  in  Palestine.  It provides  the  main  source  of  income  and  food  security  for  thousands  of  Palestinian households  through  food  supply  directly  in  the  form  of  meat,  milk,  and  eggs,  and indirectly providing income, saving, asset value and employment to the smallholders.

At the national level, the value added by  the agricultural sector in  Palestine for the year 2012 was US$ 322.6 million, which contributes about 5.9 % of the GDP. Of this, livestock contributes about 40% of agricultural GDP.

The national strategy that has vision of 'A sustainable and productive livestock sector that  is  competitive  both  locally  and  externally,  enhances  food  security  in  Palestine, promotes resilience of Palestinian breeders, and supports economic growth' carries a strategic objective  to  improve  and  increase  livestock  productivity,  profitability, competitiveness  and  contribution  to food  security, employment  generation  and economic growth.

## Institutional Infrastructure in animal health sector

The animal health care services in Palestine are under the responsibility of the General Directorate of Veterinary Services and Animal Health (GD-VSAH), one of the main directorates of MoA.  GD-VSAH  deliver  its  services  through  six  central  subdirectorates  (veterinary  field  service,  poultry  health  and  diseases,  veterinary  public health,  veterinary  quarantine  and  drug  control,  veterinary  epidemiology,  central veterinary laboratory), thirteen regional directorates in the West Bank provinces, and 5 regional directorates in the Gaza Strip. VSAH plays a pivotal role in animal health, food hygiene and public health protection, its key charge is to protect the Palestinian livestock (including both poultry and large animal) as a national wealth for country food security, as  well  as  protect  human  health  from  zoonotic  disease  transmitted  to human through diseased animals or contaminated food of animal origin.

The main activities of VSAH related to food safety include inspection of raw animal products  to  ensure  their  safety  for  human  consumption,  conducting  surveys  on  the safety of livestock products (milk, meat, and egg), issuing veterinary certificates, and controlling the circulation of animal products.

VSAH  has  well-organized  systems  in  tracing  and  diagnosing  diseases,  conducting epidemiological animal health surveys, prevention against major zoonotic and

infectious diseases through vaccination and controlling programs, controlling animal movement through areas, monitoring activities in private sector, observing veterinary medicinal products, licensing and observing activities of slaughterhouses, and many other related activities.

Central Veterinary Laboratory (CVL) is one of the six main sub-directorates of GDVSAH, it is considered as a key indicator in many of the upper mentioned activities. CVL  is  well  constructed  and  managed  according  to  global  criteria  of  veterinary laboratories,  quality  criteria  are  applied  in  different  acceptable  levels  according  to types of tests and continuous and successive process of development. Two main parts of CVL: animal health laboratory and food safety laboratory are working under one administration  to  follow  up  the  requirements  of  livestock  health  and  safety  of  their products. Diagnosis and surveillance of diseases, isolation of pathological agents and testing their sensitivity, evaluation of animal immunization, and testing of antimicrobial residues and zoonotic pathogens in raw food product of animal origin, are examples of CVL activities. Another central veterinary laboratory is constructed in Gaza strip, besides two local veterinary laboratories in Nablus and Ramallah cities in the West Bank.

Strong  governance  and  extensive  capacity  enable  any  working  system  to  offer  big successes and robust achievements, besides that, only robust plans and policies enable controlling  of  AMR,  from  this  point  VSAH  managed  several  projects  lately  to construct appropriate and modern legislations and directions able to meet the newly emerged  health  requirements  in  animal  health  sector,  as  well  as  to  strengthen  the governance  and  build  capacity.  These  projects  such  as  Draft  of  Palestinian  Animal Health  law  (2018),  National  Food  Safety  Control  Plan  (2017  -  2022),  Mandatory Technical  Instructions  62-2016:  Health  conditions  of  food  of  animal  origin  (2016), Slaughterhouses  Protocol  (2019),  Veterinary  Pharmaceuticals  Regulations  create  a good base to start with and improve upon in this area.

VSAH is considering OIE as the central reference for its activities and methodology of  work.  VSAH  is  committed  in  OIE  requirements  regarding  periodical  reports, annual  meetings,  training  courses,  and  alarms  notifications.  The  last  OIE  PVS (Performance of Veterinary Services) - mission for VSAH was in 2017 and is adopted as general guidelines for improvement and extension of VSAH activities. VSAH has also  good  communication  with  FAO  as  a  referral  international  organisation  in agricultural activities. Many projects, programs, plans, and strategies were implemented and still done under the wide cooperation between VSAH and FAO.

## Challenges in animal health sector

Nearly all animal feeds, which constitute 70% to 85% of the total production costs, are imported from Israel through a local intermediary. Feed supply is insufficient in both quality and quantity. It is not obvious whether these feeds have antibiotics in it as growth promoters.  The continuous rise of fodder prices in recent years has increased

the cost of production and forced farmers to use lower quality feed to the animals (e.g. lower quality protein mixture). As a result, the high dependence on imported inputs led to lower productivity and lower quality of animal feed.

The  health  of  animals  also  suffers  because  of  inadequate  quality  and  quantity  of animal vaccines and medicines. This can be another contributory factor for irrational use  of  substandard  antibiotics  in  Palestine.  As  a  result,  the  livestock  sector  has suffered from weak institutional and regulatory settings.

Smuggling  animals  throw  Israeli  borders  enlarged  the  issue  in  different  directions, some  of  these  animals  are  diseased  and  carrying  pathogens  of  unknown  source  or nature to Palestinian farms, other animals are food producing and suspected to have antibiotic residues, this issue need serious handling.

Shortage in veterinary health staff is a major challenge; responsibilities on VSAH are increased in a continuous manner without corresponding expansion in the staff. This issue obstacles fast completion of whole responsibilities and force VSAH to deal with priorities.

## Resistance: Unknowns challenges

It is obvious that because of low incidence of communicable diseases, the challenge of antimicrobial  resistance  has  not  been  very  high  on  national  agenda.  Given  the emergence of AMR as a global problem, its perceived impact in conflict situations where injuries are rampant can be overemphasized. Lack of adequate data because of absence  of  a  comprehensive  national  surveillance  system  on  AMR  and  quality published data is an obstacle in assessing the magnitude of problem of AMR as well as factors responsible for it.

Many individual efforts were done before 2017 in separate hospitals to work on AMS, but  no  central  or official party  took  this responsibility  until Quality  Planning Department  with  cooperation  with  USAID  started  a  big  AMS  project  on  national level,  the  project  started  with  22  hospitals  where  many  comprehensive  efforts  and activities were done to ensure rational use of antibiotics.

## Major Stakeholders

A large number of important institutions, organizations and agencies are to actively work  together  in  mitigating  AMR  to  ensure  success  in  implementation  of  NAP. Accordingly, all were engaged from the planning stage of development of NAP. Some of these are:

- 1Governmental  Organization:  Ministry  of  Health,  Ministry  of  Agriculture, Ministry  of  Education,  Ministry  of  Higher  Education,  Ministry  of  Local Governments and Environment authority.
- 2Universities and teaching institutions in both human and animal health sectors.
- 3International Agencies: UNRWA, FAO, OIE, UNICEF, UNEP and WHO.
- 4Private  Sectors:  Humans  and  Animals  health  sector  (Hospitals,  Veterinary services and laboratories).
- 5Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) and other related NGOs.

## Current status of AMR in human and animals

Antibiotic  resistance  is  prevalent  across  the  world  including  in  Palestine.  In  this country,  AMR  acquires  an  additional  dimension  because  of  the  prevailing  conflict situation. Though not articulated as such, AMR is an emerging part of a larger crisis, which often leads to poor infection control, irrational prescription practices, and easy antibiotic availability. Several outbreaks of antibiotic resistance have been documented  in  English  scientific literature. The  quality and number  of  these publications would have been much higher if infrastructure of laboratories to identify pathogens and undertake antimicrobial susceptibility testing were extensively available.

In the absence of real-time availability of antibiogram, clinicians have used empirical guidelines  to  manage  community-acquired  pneumonias.  In  a  study,  although  18 different antibiotic regimens were used, 81% patients received a β-lactam either plus macrolide  combination  therapy,  given  alone  49%  or  with  another  antibiotic  32% patients.  The  impact  of  use  of  these  regimens  of  high-end  antibiotics  remains indeterminate.

In a cross-sectional study performed in the two burn units of a teaching hospital, 118 wound samples from burn patients, 97 environmental samples and 28 samples from health  care  workers  (HCWs)  were  collected  and  cultured  according  to  the  standard microbiological procedures. Moreover, antimicrobial susceptibility ascertained using Clinical and Laboratories Standard Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common pathogen isolated 50% followed by Enterobacter cloacae 28.3%. Pseudomonas could be detected in the hospital environment as well as in the  health  care  workers.  Most  of  the  pathogens  isolated  from  patients  and environment  were  resistant  to  almost  all  antibiotics  except  piperacillin-tazobactam. Of Staphylococcus  aureus isolated  from  patients,  60%  were  Methicillin  Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

To identify the causative agents of urinary tract infections and their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics, a total of 375 specimens were collected.  Three hundred and thirty-nine (90.4%) of isolated uropathogens were Gram-negative bacteria, of which 243 (71.7%) were Escherichia coli. Thirty-six 9.6 % of the total isolates were Gram-positive bacteria of which 21, 58.3% were Staphylococcus saprophyticus. High resistance rates were recorded for E. coli against trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole (37%), nitrofurantoin 29%, ampicillin 65%, and nalidixic acid (37%). E. coli showed low resistance to amoxicillin / clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone with rates of 12.2, 17.2, 11.1, and 11.1% respectively. This study emphasized the need for developing local guidelines for rational prescribing decisions,

Acinetobacter  baumannii is  a  well-known  pathogen  of  hospital  associated  infections and  mainly  affects  immunocompromised  patients  admitted  to  intensive  care  units. These are usually multi drug resistant. Isolates from 72 patients were collected from all  over  Palestine,  except  Gaza.  These  isolates  were  resistant  to  all  the  b-lactam antibiotics  including  the  carbapenems.  Of  the  72  isolates,  77.9%  were  positive  for blaOXA-23 ,  14.7%  positive  for blaOXA-24 ,  and  4.4%  positive  for blaOXA-58 .  In addition,  5.88%  were  positive  for blaNDM . The  pathogens  were  susceptible  to colistinsulfate (78%) and tigecycline (95%) only.

The detection of these extremely drug resistant pathogens in Palestine was a strong reminder of the importance of mandating that the infection control programs in all the hospitals must be active in order to reduce the spread of these deadly pathogens.

AMR has also  been  detected  in  non-typhi Salmonella  enterica inpoultry  in  Palestine along  with  humans.    Resistance  rates  among  human  and  poultry  isolates  were respectively  59%  and  51%  for  ampicillin,  31%  and  10%  for  gentamicin,  59%  and 80%  for  tetracycline,  59%  and  45%  for  nalidixic  acid,  and  30%  and  15%  for ciprofloxacin. All the isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone. Mutations at positions 83 and/or 87 were detected in gyrA of isolates with resistance to nalidixic acid. It is essential  that  more  studies  and  continued  surveillance  of  AMR  among  human  and animal  pathogensare  needed  to  understand  the  increasing  prevalence  of  resistance, (Figure 4).

PALESTINE .

In  another  study  in  animals,  internal  organ  samples  from  83  infected  flocks  were collected  and  tested  for  presence.  The  study  of  antibiotic  susceptibility  profiles showed high resistance levels against tetracycline 100%, ampicillin 83.33%, amoxicillin 83.33%, kanamycin 80.3%, ciprofloxacin 72.72% and neomycin 69.70%, while the lowest resistance levels were against nitrofurantoin 18.18% and cephalexin 12.12%.

Interest  in  AMR  in  Palestine  scientists  has  been  demonstrated  by  their  publications that review global status of pathogens for a particular syndrome. Sweileh et al (2018) reviewed the global research output in antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens . The  paper  does  not  describe  status  of  uropathogen  and  resistance  but  summarizes various publications from across the world on his important pathology.

The  most  important  cause  of  infant  morbidity  and  mortality  in  the  Middle  East  is acute  and  chronic  diarrhea  and  resulting  conditions  of  dehydration,  marasmus,  and protein malnutrition. This is particularly the case in summer and autumn months. In recognition of the fact that routine treatment is not wholly satisfactory, a program was developed  by  the  UNRWA.    The  results  of  this  programme,  especially  the  use  of antibiotics is yet to become available.

## Safe water

Provision  of  safe  water  is  a  huge  resource  in  mitigating  infectious  diseases  thus reducing  the  use  of  antibiotics  and  resultant  emergence  of  AMR.  Studies  done  on quality  of  water  in  the  country  have  frequently  shown  that  the  total  and  faecal

coliform  contamination  exceeded  the  World  Health  Organization's  limit  for  water wells and piped water supply. However, the contamination percentages were higher in piped water supply than in wells.  Diarrhoeal diseases  were strongly  correlated  with faecal  coliform  contamination  in  piped  waters  (r=0.98).  This  is  consistent  with  the finding that diarrhoeal diseases were the most common self-reported diseases among the interviewees. Possible reasons for unsafe water supply include intermittent water supply, insufficient chlorination and sewage contamination.

## Alternate therapies

Traditional therapies have historically shown remarkable success in healing acute as well as chronic diseases. These are extensively utilized by the people who have faith in spiritual healers. Traditional medicines were believed at times to treat ailments such as infertility, epilepsy, psychosomatic troubles and depression. The available literature in English does not show role of such medicines in treatment of common infectious diseases and their impact on antimicrobial resistance.

## Work already done on AMR in Palestine

Recognizing  the  importance  of  AMR  and  in  alignment  with  the  World  Health Assembly resolution of 2015, the Ministry of Health nominated the Director of the Central Public Health Laboratory as the national focal point (NFP) for antimicrobial resistance.

Many  efforts  were  done  by  ministry  of  health  to  establish  a  national  surveillance system, all governmental hospitals reported their data to quality planning department, but with no private sector participation until 2017.

In 2017 a comprehensive AMS project (focused on infection control and prevention) was started by ministry of health with USAID support, the participants were from 22 national hospitals includes all governmental hospitals, UNRWA hospital, four private and NGOs hospitals, and five hospitals in east Jerusalem.

The activities included learning sessions, on job training for hospitals staff, couching visits by national and international experts, and networking communications by video calls and Whats App groups.

Many  indicators  were  set  by  the  experts,  hospitals  improving  teams  collected  and submitted data to quality planning department, the experts used the data to focus on improving quality and infection control aspects in hospitals, unfortunately the project stopped by the end of 2017, but USAID gave the flag to Augusta Victoria hospital (AVH) to lead this effort. Since the beginning of 2018 a new phase of AMS project was started, this time focusing on AMS.

The  project  is  still  running  with  national  expert's  efforts  who  follow  up  with  all participated hospitals in order to improve all aspects that affects AMS components.

The NFP has already obtained experience and international exposure in AMR through participation in various workshops.  The nominations have been sought from different ministries and institutions to nominate contact persons to include them in the national AMR Committee. This Committee shall oversee and guide the work on AMR in the country.

During  2018,  the  country  celebrated  the  event  of  the  World  Antibiotic  Awareness Week (WAAW)  with collaboration with several ministries and institutions, universities,  and  syndicates.  The  event  focussed  on  the  awareness  week  through posters,  videos,  presentations  from  different  ministries,  universities  and  syndicates that  summarised  the  general  ideas  for  AMR,  its  pillars  and  awareness  sections  for health  professionals  and  for  the  public.  Similar  event  has  been  planned  for  2019  in collaboration with the big national university (An-Najah National University) which provides teaching and training to the students, medical doctors, pharmacists, veterinarians,  and  lab  technicians.  The  focus  shall  be  on  importance  of  AMR  and mechanisms to contain it.

In 2019, a one-day workshop on AMR was organized which was participated by the members of the national AMR committee. The meeting discussed various issues on AMR, pillars to contain it, national AMR action plan and its possible contents. It also deliberated  upon  the  role  of  veterinary  services,  infection  prevention  and  control, laboratory-based surveillance of AMR and the antibiotic consumption in the country. The  role  of  technical  committees  for  each  of  the  pillars  of  AMR  control  was  also discussed.

## TERMS OF REFERENCE (TOR) FOR THE NFP, NATIONAL AMR COMMITTEE AND THE TECHNICAL COMMITTEE HAS BEEN DEVELOPED (ANNEX 2 . )

A  surveillance  system  for  multidrug  resistance  bacteria  (MDR)  including  patient information, sample type, type of MDR bacteria has been drafted in coordination with national experts.

It is also planned to organize a workshop for the technical groups to prepare the first draft of national action plan (NAP) which shall be finalized through a process of national consultation.

## National Strategic Plan for AMR

## Vision

Palestine  will  endeavor  to  reduce  the  morbidity,  mortality  and  economic  impact  of antimicrobial resistance.

## Mission

To protect and improve the health of Palestinian people through control of AMR by raising public awareness, forging national AMR integrated surveillance, strengthening infection  control  measures,  promoting  rational  use  of  antimicrobials  and  promoting research in Palestine

## Goals

Following  are  the  five  goals  for  Palestinian  NAP.  These  align  well  with  the  WHO Global Action Plan and incorporate all key elements that have been articulated in the GAP.

- 1. Improve awareness to reduce AMR and promote rational use of antibiotics.
- 2. Strengthen national one-health surveillance efforts for antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial use.
- 3. Implement evidence-based infection control practices to prevent the spread of resistant pathogens.
- 4. Optimize the use of antimicrobial medicines in human and animal health sectors and
- 5. Encourage and promote operational research on AMR.

## Targets

As compared to baseline data of 2020, by 2024, Palestine will achieve

-  The mortality rate associated with drug-resistant pathogens is less than 20%.
-  Human cases due to drug-resistant pathogens are less than 25%.
-  30 Percent reduction in use of antibiotics for growth promotion or prophylactic purposes in livestock, poultry, fishes.
-  10% Percent reduction in use of antibiotics therapeutic purposes in livestock, and poultry.
-  10 Percent reduction in total use of antibiotics in the country.

Several activities have been planned to achieve these targets through a national governance mechanism including monitoring and evaluation process.

## National governance mechanism

There will be a national AMR committee directly under the supervision of Minister of health, consists of 5 main technical working groups (TWG). Each strategic objective in  the  NAP  will  be  moderated  by  a  separate  TWG  that  is  composed  of different expert members from all sectors (MoH, MoA, MoHE, MoEnv, MoE etc.) involved in the NAP, (Figure 5), (Annex 1).

FIGURE 5: NAP AMR COMMITTEE

<!-- image -->

Concerted and nationally coordinated efforts shall be needed to bring together various stakeholders and harness their expertise and the resources available within the country in different sectors to efficiently implement this NAP.

Following is a step-by-step approach for implementing NAP that would be adopted by the country.

- 1. Constitution of a national antimicrobial resistance intersectoral steering committee with all stakeholders from the public and private sectors represented, which is chaired by Minister of health.
- 2. The Committee acts as coordinating mechanism and has overarching responsibility of steering the national action plan.
- 3. Allocation of adequate financial; resources on sustained basis from government, UN agencies and international development partners
- 4. Establishment, if possible, of a Unit and focal point in the MoH to coordinate with the national and international partners.
- 5. Establishment, if possible, of corresponding Unit and focal point in Ministry of Agriculture.

- 6. Designation of subgroups/Technical Working Group for each Goal comprising of specialists in the field.
- 7. Frequent meetings at different levels to review the progress and troubleshooting.
- 8. Modifications  in  NAP  according  to  the  needs,  availability  of  resources  and advances in knowledge.
- 9. Active collaboration and technical support from WHO, FAO and OIE.

## Goal 1: Improve awareness to reduce AMR and promote rational use of antibiotics

Public  awareness  on  rational  use  of  antimicrobial  agents  and  necessity  for  bringing about a change in their behaviour towards rational use of these medicines has been recognized  in  the  NAP.  Accordingly,  several  levels  of  interventions  from  general community  to  school  going  children  to  professionals  and  policy  makers  have  been identified. These shall be targeted with specific tools on a sustainable basis to bring about necessary change in their behaviour.

Palestine  shall  work  towards  making  AMR  a  core  component  of  the  professional education training, certification,  continuing  education  and  development for medical, dental, pharmacy, nursing, and veterinary professionals as well as related workers in different sectors.

All  awareness  and  behaviour  modifying  activities  will  be  carried  out  across  the country  in  a  systematic  way  and  using  evidence-based  interventions  and  tools.  The curricula  of  different  target  groups  shall  be  reviewed  and  revised.  Community  and school education, including that of farmers shall be coordinated and guided by MoH, MoA/Palestine  Veterinary  Services  (PVS),  MoE  and  various  other  sectors  with provision of adequate information on AMR and also with the focus on prevention of diseases, good hygiene and appropriate knowledge on AMR. NAP recognizes that it is a critical aspect, which has been often neglected.

## Goal 2: Strengthen national one-health surveillance efforts for antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial use

Surveillance  of  antimicrobial  resistance  and  antimicrobial  utilization  (AMU)  in humans and animals (livestock and poultry sectors) is fundamental for formulation of policy and development of programme to combat AMR. Recognizing the importance of surveillance, Palestine has resolved to establish an evidence-based surveillance for AMR and AMU. Although Palestine  has  substantial  infrastructure  and  expertise  to undertake  effective  surveillance,  it  aims  to  strengthen  descriptive  epidemiology  of resistant organisms as they emerge, understand how resistance develops and spreads, improve its capacity to rapidly characterise the emergent resistant organisms, generate trends  in  AMR  and  provide  quality  data  for  developing  antibiotics  use  policy  at national  and  local  levels.  Palestine  aims  to  become  member  of  the  WHO  Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS) and contribute its data to this global database.

By 2024, Palestine will have a nationwide AMR surveillance system in place to identify early the emergence of resistance in priority pathogens and to critical antimicrobials. Resistance profiles of priority pathogens will be reported. These efforts will be supported by quality assured national referral laboratories in human and animal health sectors and their integrated network of surveillance laboratories.

## Goal 3: Implement evidence-based infection control practices to prevent the spread of resistant pathogens

Infection prevention and control (IPC) is an extremely important aspect of a strategic plan to contain AMR. Recently Palestine health system has accorded high priority to IPC  practices  in  its health care facilities. Substantial  work  has  been  done  in establishing good infection prevention and control practices in several hospitals 4 [see chapter on situation analysis).

Hospitals  by  nature  of  their  work  are  hotbeds  for  selection  of  resistant  pathogens. Large  numbers  of  patients  whose  defences  have  been  compromised  inhabit  these facilities. Antibiotics are extensively administered to these patients to save their lives, cut short infectious diseases and at times to prevent their being infected. The health facility ecosystem is hence conducive for selection of resistant pathogens, and spread of resistance,

Better hygiene, and infection prevention control (IPC) also represent methods to cut down on the spread of infections in ambulatory human and animal care facilities, in food production systems and in the community in general.

Vaccination in humans and animals and bio security in food production systems are specific interventions belonging to IPC interventions that if implemented effectively, can result in better health outcomes and reduced risk of emergence of AMR. Palestine has  excellent  vaccination  coverage  and  it  needs  to  be  sustained  and  expanded  for better results especially amongst the animal population.

Palestine has made considerable progress in implementing IPC measures in governmental health settings. There is an urgent need to expand these activities in all health care facilities in public and private sector health facilities.

With rapidly increasing demand for food from animals, it is essential to strengthen the biosecurity  in  animal  and  poultry  farms  to  assure  supply  of  antibiotic  and  resistant pathogen free food products.

## Goal 4: Optimize the use of antimicrobial medicines in human and animal health sectors

Emergence of resistance in microorganisms is a natural and unstoppable phenomenon. Selection  pressure  exerted  by  antimicrobial  agents  accelerates  the  emergence  of resistant  strains  and  their  becoming  predominant  population  in  any  setting.  Use  of antimicrobials in any form, even when rational and prudent, can precipitate resistance in target microbes. Easy access to these affordable medicines during past few decades has resulted in its rampant misuse leading to AMR in virtually all pathogens.

In  Palestine,  antibiotics  have  been  categorized  as  essential  medicines  and  constitute almost  10%  of  essential  drugs  list  [EDL].  The  General  Directorate  of  Pharmacy through  its  seven  departments  ensures  that  effective  and  safe  medicines  of  good quality  are  affordable,  available  and  rationally  used,  through  the  application  of regulations and instructions of the Ministry of Health.

One of the prerequisites for registering and sale of antibiotics at the Ministry of Health (MoH) is that  the  label  on  the  antibiotics  must  clearly  mention  that  this  product  is available only by prescription ("prescription only" Rx).

Palestine proposes to further strengthen its system for regulation and surveillance of use of antimicrobial agents for control of human and veterinary use of antimicrobials through activities in the National Action Plan for AMR.  Some of the measures taken will  include  development  of  standard  treatment  guidelines  with  special  reference  to use  of  antimicrobial  agents,  evidence-based  guidelines  for  National  Antimicrobial Stewardship Programme in human and animal health care, and continuous coordination with the AMR and AMU surveillance system.

## Goal 5: Encourage and promote operational research on AMR

Research in health is an instrument that can facilitate strengthening of health system including  efficient  implementation  of  all  health-related  programmes.  operational research (OR) can improve understanding of the challenges being faced by the health sector in implementation of their mandate and suggest suitable field-tested remedial measures and create base line data in Palestine.

High calibre medical and veterinary schools are functional in Palestine. These should be encouraged and mandated to undertake research applicable to solve national health problems.  A  strong  collaboration  between  the  Ministry  of  Health,  Ministry  of Agriculture  and  Ministry  of  Higher  Education  can  help  in  identifying  research priorities.  Suitable  grants  and  oversight  on  funded  research  shall  further  strengthen this collaboration.

Implementation of national action plan to combat antimicrobial resistance shall raise several  issues  and  is  likely  to  encounter  impediments  at  local  level.  These  can  be addressed by Palestinian researchers to ensure smooth operations of activities in the NAP.
