## Executive Summary

Antibiotics have been a critical public health tool since the discovery of penicillin in 1928, saving the lives of millions of people around the world .  Today, however, the emergence of drug resistance in bacteria is reversing the miracles of the past eighty years, with drug choices for the treatment of many bacterial infections becoming increasingly limited, expensive, and, in some cases, nonexistent .  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that drug-resistant bacteria cause two million illnesses and approximately 23,000 deaths each year in the United States alone .

The National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-resistant Bacteria provides a roadmap to guide the Nation in rising to this challenge .  Developed in response to Executive Order 13676: Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria-issued by President Barack Obama on September 18, 2014-the National Action Plan outlines steps for implementing the National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria and addressing the policy recommendations of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) .  Although its primary purpose is to guide activities by the U .S . Government, the National Action Plan is also designed to guide action by public health, healthcare, and veterinary partners in a common effort to address urgent and serious drug-resistant threats that affect people in the U .S . and around the world .  Implementation of the National Action Plan will also support World Health Assembly resolution 67 .25 (Antimicrobial Resistance), which urges countries to take urgent action at the national, regional, and local levels to combat resistance .

## The goals of the National Action Plan include:

- 1. Slow the Emergence of Resistant Bacteria and Prevent the Spread of Resistant Infections .
- 2. Strengthen National One-Health Surveillance Efforts to Combat Resistance .
- 3. Advance Development and Use of Rapid and Innovative Diagnostic Tests for Identification and Characterization of Resistant Bacteria .
- 4. Accelerate Basic and Applied Research and Development for New Antibiotics, Other Therapeutics, and Vaccines .
- 5. Improve International Collaboration and Capacities for Antibiotic-resistance Prevention, Surveillance, Control, and Antibiotic Research and Development .

By 2020, implementation of the National Action Plan will lead to major reductions in the incidence of urgent and serious threats, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Clostridium difficile (see Table 1) .  The National Action Plan will also result in improved antibiotic stewardship in healthcare settings, prevention of the spread of drug-resistant threats, elimination of the use of medically-important antibiotics for growth promotion in food animals, and expanded surveillance for drug-resistant bacteria in humans and animals . Other significant outcomes include creation of a regional public health laboratory network, establishment of a specimen repository and sequence database that can be accessed by industrial and academic researchers, development of new diagnostic tests through a national challenge, and development of two or more

antibiotic drug candidates or non-traditional therapeutics for treatment of human disease .  In addition, the effort to combat resistant bacteria will become an international priority for global health security .

Progress towards achieving these outcomes will be monitored by the U .S . Government Task Force that developed the National Action Plan. The Task Force, which is co-chaired by the Secretaries of Defense, Agriculture, and Health and Human Services, includes representatives from the Departments of State, Justice, Veterans Affairs, and Homeland Security, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Agency for International Development, the Office of Management and Budget, the Domestic Policy Council, the National Security Council, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the National Science Foundation .  Additionally, the Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, created by Executive Order 13676, will provide advice, information, and recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services regarding the National Action Plan's programs and policies and their impact on the threat .

Implementation of the objectives and activities in the National Action Plan requires sustained, coordinated, and complementary efforts of individuals and groups around the world, including healthcare providers, healthcare leaders, veterinarians, agriculture industry leaders, manufacturers, policymakers, and patients .  All of us who depend on antibiotics must join in a common effort to detect, stop, and prevent the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria .

## Introduction

Vision: The United States will work domestically and internationally to prevent, detect, and control illness and death related to infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria by implementing measures to mitigate the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistance and ensuring the continued availability of therapeutics for the treatment of bacterial infections.

Antibiotics have been a critical public health tool since the discovery of penicillin in 1928, saving the lives of millions of people around the world .  Today, however, the emergence of drug resistance in bacteria is reversing the gains of the past eighty years, with many important drug choices for the treatment of bacterial infections becoming increasingly limited, expensive, and, in some cases, nonexistent .  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that each year at least two million illnesses and 23,000 deaths are caused by drug-resistant bacteria in the United States alone .

The loss of antibiotics that kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria means that we can no longer take for granted quick and reliable treatment of rare or common bacterial infections, including bacterial pneumonias, foodborne illnesses, and healthcare-associated infections .  As more strains of bacteria become resistant to an ever larger number of antibiotics, we will also lose the benefits of a range of modern medical procedures-from hip replacements to organ transplants-whose safety depends on our ability to treat bacterial infections that may arise as post-surgical complications .  Moreover, antibiotic-resistance also threatens animal health, agriculture, and the economy .

The National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-resistant Bacteria provides a roadmap to guide the Nation in rising to this challenge .  The National Action Plan outlines steps for implementing the National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria and addressing the policy recommendations of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology .  Although its primary purpose is to guide activities by the U .S . Government, the National Action Plan is also designed to guide action by public health, healthcare, and veterinary partners in a common effort to address urgent and serious drugresistant threats (Table 3) that affect people in the U .S . and around the world .

Scope of the National Action Plan: 'Antibiotic resistance' results from mutations or acquisition of new genes in bacteria that reduce or eliminate the effectiveness of antibiotics .  'Antimicrobial resistance' is a broader term that encompasses resistance to drugs to treat infections caused by many different types of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses (e .g ., influenza and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)), parasites (e .g ., the parasitic protozoan that causes malaria), and fungi (e .g ., Candida spp. ) .  While all of these pathogens are dangerous to human health, the National Action Plan focuses on resistance in bacteria that present an urgent or serious threat to public health .

## Goals of the National Action Plan

The National Action Planinformed by the guiding principles in Table 2 -is organized around five goals for collaborative action by the U .S . Government, in partnership with foreign governments, individuals, and organizations aiming to strengthen healthcare, public health, veterinary medicine, agriculture, food safety, and research and manufacturing .  Aggressive action will move the nation towards major reductions in the incidence of urgent and serious drug-resistant threats (Table 3), including carbapenemresistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Clostridium difficile.

- · Misuse and over-use of antibiotics in healthcare and food production continue to hasten the development of bacterial drug resistance, leading to loss of efficacy of existing antibiotics .
- · Detecting and controlling antibiotic-resistance requires the adoption of a  'One-Health' approach to disease surveillance that recognizes that resistance can arise in humans, animals, and the environment .
- · Implementation of evidence-based infection control practices can prevent the spread of resistant pathogens .
- · Interventions are necessary to accelerate private sector investment in the development of therapeutics to treat bacterial infections because current private sector interest in antibiotic development is limited .
- · Researchers can use innovations and new technologies-including whole genome sequencing, metagenomics, and bioinformatic approaches-to develop next-generation tools to strengthen human and animal health, including:
- -Point-of-need diagnostic tests to distinguish rapidly between bacterial and viral infections as well as identify bacterial drug susceptibilities;
- -New antibiotics and other therapies that provide much needed treatment options for those infected with resistant bacterial strains; and
- -Antibiotic resistance is a global health problem that requires international attention and collaboration, because bacteria do not recognize borders .

- * This target is consistent with the reduction goal for MRSA bloodstream infections (BSI) in the National Action Plan to Prevent Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI): Road Map to Elimination, which calls for a 75% decline in MRSA BSI from the 2007-2008 baseline by 2020 .  Additional information is available at http://www .health .gov/hai/prevent\_hai .asp#hai\_plan .

1 The TB activities identified in the NAP are included as they represent critical near-term public health activities that will support progress to reduce the burden of drug-resistant TB in the U .S .  Additional domestic and global activities to address drug-resistant TB will be provided in a companion action plan specific to TB and will be submitted to the President no later than September, 2015 .  The companion action plan will build on recommendations of the Federal TB Task Force (http://www .cdc .gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr5803 .pdf) as well the work of the interagency USG TB working group .

## Those goals include:

## GOAL 1: Slow the Emergence of Resistant Bacteria and Prevent the Spread of Resistant

Infections. Judicious use of antibiotics in healthcare and agricultural settings is essential to slow the emergence of resistance and extend the useful lifetime of effective antibiotics . Antibiotics are a precious resource, and preserving their usefulness will require cooperation and engagement by healthcare providers, healthcare leaders, pharmaceutical companies, veterinarians, the agricultural industry, and patients .  Goal 1 activities include the optimal use of vaccines to prevent infections, implementation of healthcare policies and antibiotic stewardship programs that improve patient outcomes, and efforts to minimize the development of resistance by ensuring that each patient receives the right antibiotic at the right time at the right dose for the right duration. Prevention of resistance also requires rapid detection and control of outbreaks and regional efforts to control transmission across community and healthcare settings .

GOAL 2: Strengthen National One-Health Surveillance Efforts to Combat Resistance. Improved detection and control of drug-resistant organisms will be achieved through an integrated, 'One-Health' approach that includes the enhancement and integration of data from surveil-

lance systems that monitor human pathogens -including the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), the Emerging Infections Program (EIP), and the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) -with data from surveillance systems that monitor animal pathogens-including the National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS), the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN), and the Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network (Vet-LIRN) .  Goal 2 activities include creation of a regional public health laboratory network that provides a standardized platform for resistance testing and advanced capacity for genetic characterization of bacteria (e .g ., through whole genome sequencing) .  Goal 2 activities will also enhance monitoring of antibiotic sales, usage, resistance, and management practices at multiple points along in the food-production chain, from farms to processing plants to supermarkets .

Advance Development and Use of Rapid and Innovative Diagnostic Tests for Improved diagnostics for detection of resistant bacteria and characterization of resistance patterns will help healthcare providers make optimal treatment decisions and assist public health officials in taking action to prevent and control disease .  Improved diagnostics will also help decrease unnecessary or inappropriate use of antibiotics .  Goal 3 activities will accelerate the development of new diagnostics and expand their availability and use to improve treatment, enhance infection control, and achieve faster response to infections and outbreaks caused by resistant bacteria

GOAL 3: Identification and Characterization of Resistant Bacteria. in hospitals and in the community .

## GOAL 4: Accelerate Basic and Applied Research and Development for New Antibiotics, Other

Therapeutics, and Vaccines. Despite the urgent need for new antibiotics, the number of products in the drug-development pipeline is small and commercial interest remains limited . The advancement of drug development-as well as non-traditional therapeutics and vaccines-will require intensified efforts to boost scientific research, attract private investment, and facilitate clinical trials of new drug candidates .  Goal 4 activities will help accomplish these objectives by supporting basic and applied research, providing researchers with scientific services (e .g ., specimens, sequence data, and regulatory guidance), and fostering publicprivate partnerships that strengthen the clinical trials infrastructure and reduce the risks, uncertainty, and obstacles faced by companies who are developing new antibiotics and/or other therapeutics and vaccines that can impact the use of antibiotics and the development of resistance .

GOAL 5:

Improve International Collaboration and Capacities for Antibiotic-resistance Prevention, Surveillance, Control, and Antibiotic Research and Development. Antibiotic resistance is a worldwide problem that cannot be addressed by one nation in isolation .  Goal 5 activities include working with foreign ministries of health and agriculture, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and other multinational organizations to enhance global capacity to detect, analyze, and report antibiotic use and resistance, create incentives for the development of therapeutics and diagnostics, and strengthen global efforts to prevent and control the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistance .  To advance these objectives, U .S . agencies will support development of a WHO Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance , enhance

international collaborations including cooperation under the European Union-United States Trans-Atlantic Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance (TATFAR), and mobilize global health resources through the Global Health Security Agenda .

## Development of the National Action Plan

The National Action Plan was developed in response to Executive Order 13676: Combating AntibioticResistant Bacteria (Appendix 2), which was issued by President Barack Obama on September 18, 2014 in conjunction with the National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria.

The Executive Order calls for a U .S . Government Task Force to create a five-year action plan that lays out steps and milestones for achieving the Strategy's goals and objectives (Table 2) and addressing the PCAST recommendations .  The Task Force, which is co-chaired by the Secretaries of Defense, Agriculture, and Health and Human Services, includes representatives from the Department of State, the Department of Justice, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Homeland Security, the Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Agency for International Development, the Office of Management and Budget, the Domestic Policy Council, the National Security Council staff, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the National Science Foundation .

Development of the National Action Plan also supports World Health Assembly (WHA) resolution 67 .25 (Antimicrobial Resistance), which was endorsed in May 2014 and urges countries to develop and finance national plans and strategies and take urgent action at the national, regional, and local levels to combat resistance .  The resolution urges WHA Member States to develop practical and feasible approaches to, among other actions, extend the lifespan of drugs, strengthen pharmaceutical management systems and laboratory infrastructure, develop effective surveillance systems, and encourage the development of new diagnostics, drugs, and treatment options .

These recommendations are intended to inform the policy development process, and are not intended as a budget document .  The commitment of resources to support these activities will be determined through the usual Executive Branch budget processes .  Implementation of some of the actions in this report will require additional resources and these resources could be new or redirected from lowerpriority Agency activities .

## Monitoring and Evaluation

The Task Force created under Executive Order 13676 is charged with providing the President with annual updates on Federal Government actions to combat antibiotic resistance, including progress made in implementing the National Action Plan , plans for addressing obstacles and challenges, and recommendations for new or modified actions .  The Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria will provide advice, information, and recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services regarding the programs and policies developed in the National Action Plan .

## Partnerships and Implementation

Implementation of the National Action Plan will require the sustained, coordinated, and complementary efforts of individuals and groups around the world, including public and private sector partners, healthcare providers, healthcare leaders, veterinarians, agriculture industry leaders, manufacturers, policymakers, and patients .  All of us who depend on antibiotics must join in a common effort to detect, stop, and prevent the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria .

## GOAL 1. Slow the Emergence of Resistant Bacteria and Prevent the Spread of Resistant Infections

Actions taken to achieve Goal 1 will fulfill:

## · Executive Order 13676, Sections 5 and 7:

- -Improved Antibiotic Stewardship
- -Preventing and Responding to Infections and Outbreaks with Antibiotic-Resistant Organisms

## · Provisions in PCAST Recommendations #2, #6, and #7:

- -Effective Surveillance &amp;amp; Response for Antibiotic-resistance
- -Improving Stewardship of Existing Antibiotics in Health Care
- -Limit the Use of Antibiotics in Animal Agriculture

Judicious use of antibiotics in healthcare and agricultural settings is essential to slow the emergence of resistance and extend the useful lifetime of effective antibiotics .  Antibiotics are a precious resource, and preserving their usefulness will require cooperation and engagement by healthcare providers, healthcare leaders, pharmaceutical companies, veterinarians, the agricultural industry, and patients . Effective dissemination of information to the public is critical .  Prevention of resistance also requires rapid detection and control of infections and outbreaks (see also Goal 2) and regional efforts to control transmission across community and healthcare settings .

Goal 1 includes activities to foster antibiotic stewardship by improving prescribing practices across all healthcare settings, prevent the spread of drug-resistant threats in healthcare facilities and communities, and reduce and eventually eliminate the use of medically-important antibiotics for growth promotion in animals .

By 2020, significant outcomes of Goal 1 will include:

- · Establishment of antibiotic stewardship programs in all acute care hospitals and improved antibiotic stewardship across all healthcare settings .
- · Reduction of inappropriate antibiotic use by 50% in outpatient settings and by 20% in inpatient settings .
- · Establishment of State Antibiotic Resistance (AR) Prevention (Protect) Programs in all 50 states to monitor regionally important multidrug resistant organisms and provide feedback and technical assistance to healthcare facilities .

- · Elimination of the use of medically-important antibiotics for growth promotion in food-producing animals .
- · Requirement of veterinary oversight for use of medically-important antibiotics in the feed or water of food-producing animals .

## 1.1 Implement public health programs and reporting policies that advance antibiotic resistance prevention and foster antibiotic stewardship in healthcare settings and the community.

Perhaps the single most important action to slow the development and spread of antibiotic-resistant infections is to change the way antibiotics are used .  Antibiotics are overprescribed in both human and animal settings, which makes everyone less safe .  Investments in this area will be used to develop education and outreach programs to clarify and strengthen responsible, appropriate use of antibiotics in humans and animals .  Efforts in this area will help greatly in slowing down the spread of resistant bacteria .  This commitment to always use antibiotics appropriately and safely-to use the right antibiotic at the right time at the right dose for the right duration -is known as antibiotic stewardship .

Sub-Objective 1.1.1A: Strengthen antibiotic stewardship in inpatient, outpatient, and longterm care settings by expanding existing programs, developing new ones, and monitoring progress and efficacy .

The establishment and expansion of antibiotic stewardship programs will improve patient outcomes and minimize the development of resistance by ensuring judicious use of antibiotics .

Milestones for provision of educational materials to enhance antibiotic stewardship in outpatient settings are provided under Sub-Objective 1 .1 .1B .

## Milestones

## Within one year:

- · The Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Defense (DOD), and Veterans Affairs (VA) will review existing regulations and propose new ones, as needed, requiring hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, dialysis facilities, and other inpatient facilities to implement robust antibiotic stewardship programs that align with the CDC Core Elements. HHS, DOD, and VA will also work together to optimize standardization of stewardship programs and activities, including monitoring activities and reporting criteria .
- · The National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) will begin tracking the number of healthcare facilities with stewardship policies and programs in place .
- · DOD will establish a multidisciplinary group, under the purview of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, to support and coordinate stewardship activities across DOD .

## Within three years:

- · All hospitals that participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs must comply with Conditions of Participation (COP) .  The Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) will issue new COPs or revise current COP Interpretive Guidelines to advance compliance with recommendations in CDC's Core Elements of Hospital Antibiotic Stewardship Programs. HHS, DOD, and VA will also implement policies that:
- -Encourage implementation of antibiotic stewardship programs as a condition for receiving Federal grants for health care delivery (e .g ., in community healthcare centers) .
- -Require health facilities operated by the U .S . Government to develop and implement antibiotic stewardship programs and participate in NHSN reporting (see Objective 2 .2) .
- · All acute care hospitals governed by the CMS COP will implement antibiotic stewardship programs .  CMS will expand COP requirements to apply to long-term acute care hospitals, other post-acute facilities, ambulatory surgery centers, and dialysis centers .
- · CMS will revise existing Interpretive Guidelines (IGs), as needed, to include antimicrobial stewardship improvements .  For example, IGs on Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement for hospitals may incorporate antibiotic-stewardship performance measures developed by the CDC, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), or other professional organizations .
- · Training webinars for CMS surveyors will be updated to include information on antibiotic utilization in nursing homes, in accordance with existing IGs in the Infection Control Nursing Home regulations .
- · CDC, CMS, AHRQ, and other partners will issue guidance on antibiotic stewardship and best practices for ambulatory surgery centers, dialysis centers, nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, doctors' offices and other outpatient settings, pharmacies, emergency departments, and medical departments at correctional facilities .
- · At least 25 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico will establish or enhance antibiotic stewardship activities in inpatient healthcare delivery settings, in accordance with the CDC Core Elements .  CDC will support these efforts via State AR Prevention (Protect) Programs for Healthcare ('AR Protect Programs'; see also Sub-Objective 1 .1 .2) .

## Within five years:

- · DOD will support antibiotic stewardship programs and interventions critical for maintaining quality health care throughout the Military Healthcare System (MHS) .
- · CDC will work with select hospital systems to expand antibiotic use reporting and stewardship implementation, and will partner with nursing organizations to develop and implement stewardship programs and interventions in a set of nursing homes .
- · All states will establish or enhance antibiotic stewardship activities in healthcare delivery settings .

Sub-Objective 1.1.1B: Strengthen educational programs that inform physicians, veterinarians, members of the agricultural industry, and the public about good antibiotic stewardship . Educational programs that promote good antibiotic stewardship in healthcare settings include:

- · Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work .  Many antibiotics prescribed in doctors' offices, clinics, and other outpatient settings are not needed .  This program focuses on appropriate antibiotic prescribing and use for common illnesses in children and adults .
- · Get Smart for Healthcare. Many patients in hospitals, nursing homes, and other healthcare facilities receive antibiotics to fight infections, but these drugs are often prescribed incorrectly .  This program helps clinicians prescribe the right drugs for the right patients at the right doses and times .

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), CDC, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will also continue to work with partners in the agriculture industry to advance appropriate use of antibiotics in food animals and promote collaborations among partners in medicine, veterinary medicine, and public health .

Additional milestones for provision of educational materials to enhance antibiotic stewardship in agricultural settings are provided under Sub-Objectives 1 .2 .3 and 1 .3 .1 .

## Milestones

## Within one year:

- · CDC and VA will apply lessons learned from the CDC and VA pilot project to provide clinicians with support for making prescribing decisions based on judicious use of antibiotics and will submit a manuscript for publication describing initial research findings from this effort .

## Within three years:

- · CDC will support public health departments in establishing statewide programs for antibiotic stewardship and appropriate antibiotic use .  These programs will identify healthcare facilities with high antibiotic-prescribing rates and use lessons learned from the CDC and VA pilot project (see above) and other best practices to improve antibiotic prescribing in these facilities .  The success of these efforts will be assessed by measuring changes in prescribing rates and in clinicians' understanding of antibiotic stewardship activities and programs .
- · CDC will provide technical assistance to Federal facilities (e .g ., those operated by DOD, the VA, and the Indian Health Service) and other large health systems in scaling up implementation and assessment of interventions to improve outpatient antibiotic prescribing, extending effective interventions to long-term care settings, and ensuring long-term sustainability of antibiotic stewardship efforts .
- · DOD will initiate the planning and approval process to modify clinical decision-support interventions in DOD facilities in targeted regions .
- · CDC, CMS, and partners will propose expanded quality measures for antibiotic prescribing .

- · CMS will expand the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) to include quality measures that discourage inappropriate antibiotic use to treat non-bacterial infections, such as respiratory tract infections .
- · CDC will expand training and support to acute care facilities and nursing homes to improve antibiotic stewardship, as part of the Get Smart for Healthcare project .

## Within five years:

- · CDC will evaluate the impact of quality measures on antibiotic use and provide feedback to healthcare partners .

Additionally, CDC will continue to host a Get Smart About Antibiotics Week observance each November to raise public awareness about antibiotic-resistance and the importance of appropriate antibiotic prescribing .

Sub-Objective 1.1.2: Expand collaborative efforts by groups of healthcare facilities that focus on preventing the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that pose a serious threat to public health (Table 3) .

Public health action to prevent transmission of healthcare-associated infections-including drugresistant bacterial infections-has traditionally been taken by individual healthcare facilities .  However, drug-resistant organisms-including multidrug resistant organisms (MDROs) such as CRE and MRSA, and Clostridium difficile infections that are associated with antibiotic use (Table 3)-can spread regionally from one healthcare facility to another when patients colonized or infected with resistant bacteria move between hospitals or long-term care facilities within a state or locality .  It is therefore imperative that healthcare facilities work together, in close partnership with state health departments, to implement effective interventions that slow the regional spread of drug-resistant pathogens .

## Milestones

## Within one year:

- · The DOD Multidrug-Resistant Organism Repository &amp;amp; Surveillance Network (MRSN) will expand its detection and reporting capabilities to include Clostridium difficile and other high-risk drugresistant pathogens .

## Within three years:

- · At least 25 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico will establish or enhance State AR Prevention (Protect) Programs to improve antibiotic use and reduce transmission of resistant pathogens .  Activities will include measuring the incidence of at least one regionally important MDRO, providing healthcare facilities with feedback on local and regional MDRO rates, and providing healthcare facilities with technical assistance to advance MDRO prevention .  CDC and CMS Quality Improvement Networks (QINs) will work with state and large local health

departments to advance these efforts .  QINs are groups of health quality experts, clinicians, and consumers who help improve the care delivered to people with Medicare .

- · At least 20 state health departments will maintain advanced capacity for rapid response to drug-resistant gonorrhea, including capacity to detect, diagnose, and investigate suspected resistant cases within their state or region and assist healthcare providers in providing appropriate treatment of infected patients .

## Within five years:

- · CDC will expand capacity to prevent the importation of cases of multidrug resistant Tuberculosis (TB) (MDR-TB) by doubling TB screening among migrants from high-incidence countries from 500,000 to 1 million persons per year .
- · State AR Prevention (Protect) Programs will be in place in all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico .

Sub-Objective 1.1.3: Implement annual reporting of antibiotic use in inpatient and outpatient settings and identify geographic variations and/or variations at the provider and/ or patient level that can help guide interventions .

Antibiotic resistance in healthcare settings is a significant threat to public health .  Because nearly all Americans receive care in a healthcare setting at some point in their lives, the problem can affect anyone . Patients undergoing chemotherapy for cancer and very sick patients in intensive care units are at special risk, because they are already vulnerable due to weakened immune systems and underlying illness .

Through its antibiotic use (AU) and antimicrobial resistance (AR) modules, the National Health Safety Network (NHSN) receives hospital data on:

- · Amounts of specific antibiotics used to treat hospitalized patients (AU reporting) .
- · Cases of drug-resistant disease (AR reporting) .

The AU and AR data allow healthcare facilities to target areas of concern, make needed improvements, and track the success of their efforts .  NHSN data also allow CDC to track regional and national trends in drug resistant diseases and provide hospitals with feedback about prescribing practices and antibiotic stewardship .

Milestones for AU reporting are provided below, as part of the effort to foster antibiotic stewardship . Additional milestones for AR reporting and for strengthening the public health surveillance infrastructure that supports AU and AR reporting are provided in Goal 2 .

## Milestones: Reporting Antibiotic Use in Inpatient Settings

## Within one year:

- · CDC will finalize arrangements for the purchase of proprietary data on inpatient antibiotic use to supplement NHSN data until a larger number of hospitals begin to utilize the NHSN module for antibiotic use reporting .
- · CDC will work with healthcare and public health partners to propose new healthcare-facility antibiotic use measures to the National Quality Forum (NQF; see also Sub-Objective 2 .2 .1) .

## Within three years:

- · CDC will use data collected through the NHSN AU module to provide annual national estimates of aggregated inpatient antibiotic use and feedback to healthcare facilities on antibiotic use, indicating whether antibiotic use rates are above or below the national average .
- · CDC will establish routine reporting of antibiotic use and resistance data from select hospital systems via the NHSN AU and AR modules (see Objective 2 .2) .
- · DOD will centralize its reporting of inpatient antibiotic use to NHSN .

## Within five years:

- · CDC will provide estimates of inappropriate inpatient antibiotic prescribing rates by state and region and use this data to target and prioritize intervention efforts .

## Milestones: Reporting Antibiotic Use in Outpatient Settings

## Within one year:

- · CDC will report outpatient prescribing rates for 2011 and 2012 and use this data to target and prioritize intervention efforts .
- · CDC will establish a benchmark (in terms of prescriptions per population) for reduction in antibiotic use .

## Within three years:

- · Starting in 2016, CDC will issue yearly reports on progress in meeting the national target of 50% reduction in inappropriate use of antibiotics in outpatient settings (see above), as well as on overall trends in antibiotic prescribing .
- · DOD will establish goals for reducing antibiotic use in DOD facilities that provide outpatient care for military personnel and their families .
- · DOD will centralize reporting of outpatient antibiotic use and issue annual summary reports .

Sub-Objective 1.1.4: Develop and pilot new interventions to address geographic, sociocultural, policy, economic, and clinical drivers of the emergence and spread of antibioticresistance and misuse or overuse of antibiotics .

## Milestones

## Within one year:

- · The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and CDC will host a meeting of experts and stakeholders to considerknowledge gaps for prevention of antibiotic-resistant, healthcareassociated infections and identify potential interventions for development, field testing, and eventual widespread implementation .
- · CDC Emerging Infections Program (EIP) sites will perform assessments of antibiotic use and resistance to allow updating of national estimates of antibiotic-resistant, healthcare-associated infections and of antibiotic-resistance threats in the United States .
- · CDC EIP sites will solicit applications for funding large-scale interventions to reduce C. difficile infections through enhanced antibiotic stewardship programs .

## Within three years:

- · The CDC Prevention Epicenters Program will evaluate one or more novel antibiotic-resistance prevention tools for use in diverse healthcare settings .
- · CDC EIP sites will initiate large-scale demonstration projects to field-test AR interventions developed by the Prevention Epicenters Program .
- · AHRQ will sponsor research to develop improved methods and approaches for combating antibiotic-resistance and conducting antibiotic stewardship activities in multiple healthcare settings, with a focus on long-term and ambulatory care centers, as well as acute care hospitals . AHRQ will support translation of research findings into antibiotic-resistance prevention tools that can be implemented by healthcare providers in long-term and ambulatory care settings, as well as in hospitals .
- · CDC will perform two randomized control trials to test improved treatment methods to prevent the spread of MDR-TB .

## Within five years:

- · CDC will finalize data collection to validate new antibiotic-resistance prevention tools tested by the EIP sites and transition validated interventions to ongoing State AR Prevention (Protect) Programs .

Sub-Objective 1.1.5: Streamline regulatory processes for updating and approving or clearing antibiotic susceptibility testing devices, as appropriate, so that clinicians receive up-to-date interpretive criteria to guide antibacterial drug selection .

Manufacturers of antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) devices provide interpretive criteria that are used by healthcare providers to categorize a bacterial isolate as 'susceptible' or 'resistant' to particular antibiotics .  However, when bacteria develop new means of resistance, the interpretive criteria may no longer be clinically useful . Rapid updating of interpretive criteria in AST devices-by manufacturers or by standards development organizations (SDOs)-is therefore essential to provide accurate information to guide appropriate drug treatment .

## Milestones

## Within one year:

- · FDA will provide technical assistance, as appropriate, on legislative proposals being considered to streamline updating of interpretive criteria for AST devices .

## Within five years:

- · FDA will update AST interpretive criteria more efficiently and rapidly (e .g ., by adopting criteria developed by SDOs rather than including interpretive guidelines on labels) .

## 1.2 Eliminate the use of medically important antibiotics for growth promotion in food-producing animals and bring under veterinary oversight other in-feed and in-water uses of antibiotics that are medically important for treatment, control, and prevention of disease.

FDA's strategy to ensure the judicious use of medically important antibiotics in animal agriculture is outlined in two guidance documents:

- · FDA Guidance for Industry (GFI) #209The Judicious Use of Medically Important Antimicrobial Drugs in Food-Producing Animals -is intended to limit medically important antimicrobial drugs to uses in animals that (1) are considered necessary for assuring animal health, and (2) include veterinary oversight or consultation .
- · FDA Guidance for Industry (GFI) #213New Animal Drugs and New Animal Drug Combination Products Administered in or on Medicated Feed or Drinking Water of Food-Producing Animals: Recommendations for Drug Sponsors for Voluntarily Aligning Product Use Conditions with GFI #2 09-calls for:
- -Voluntary revision of the FDA-approved use conditions on the labels of medically important antibiotics to remove production indications, such as increased rate of weight gain and improved feed efficiency .

- -Phasing in veterinary oversight of the remaining therapeutic uses of medically important antibiotics in feed or water by changing the current over-the-counter status of these drugs . Because antibiotics in feed or water are typically administered to herds or flocks of foodproducing animals, in-feed or in-water antibiotic use leads to an increased risk of selecting for resistance .

Sub-Objective 1.2.1: Implement FDA GFI #213 to eliminate the use of medically important antibiotics for growth promotion in animals and bring other in-feed and in-water uses of medically important antibiotics under veterinary oversight .  FDA should evaluate the adoption of the proposed changes under GFI #213 after the three-year implementation period and take further action as appropriate .

## Milestones

## Within one year:

- · FDA will finalize changes to the Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) regulation to encourage manufacturers to transition the dispensing status of in-feed antibiotics covered by GFI #213 from over-the-counter (OTC) to VFD status, which requires veterinary oversight .  FDA will publish an enhanced summary report of antibiotics sold or distributed for use in food-producing animals from 2009 to 2013 .  This report will support the effort to monitor the antibiotic usage aspects of Guidance #213 (see also Objective 2 .2 .4) .

## Within three years:

- · FDA, in partnership with animal drug sponsors, will complete all changes recommended by GFI #213 and GFI #209 .  Once these changes are complete, growth promotion uses of medically important antibiotics will no longer be permitted, and the use of medically important antibiotics in the feed or water of food-producing animals will require veterinary oversight .

Sub-Objective 1.2.2: Assess progress toward eliminating the use of medically important antibiotics for growth promotion in food-producing animals through enhanced data collection on antibiotic sales and use .

## Milestones

## Within five years:

- · FDA, in partnership with USDA and the animal agricultural industry, will evaluate and report on the impact of GFI #213 by analyzing data on antibiotic use, including total sales of antibiotics in animal agriculture and types and prevalence of antibiotic-resistance among selected foodborne pathogens and commensals isolated from retail meat and farm animals .

Milestones for enhancing collection of data to monitor the impact of GFI #213 in fostering the judicious use of antibiotics in food-producing animals are provided under Objective 2 .4 .

Sub-Objective 1.2.3: Develop and implement educational outreach efforts to ensure that veterinarians and animal producers receive information and training to support implementation of these changes .

## Within three years:

- · FDA will collaborate with veterinary organizations, animal producer organizations, the animal feed industry, and others to develop and implement educational outreach efforts to ensure that veterinarians and animal producers receive the necessary information and training to support implementation of GFI #213 (see also: Sub-Objective 1 .3 .1) .

Sub-Objective 1.2.4: Optimize public awareness about progress toward eliminating the use of medically important antibiotics for animal-growth promotion .

## Within one year:

- · FDA will publish and maintain a public web listing of products affected by GFI #213 .
- · FDA will begin publishing periodic updates summarizing progress in adoption of the changes proposed in GFI #213 .

## Within three years:

- · FDA will publish a final assessment of the progress of GFI #213 on eliminating the use of medically important antibiotics for animal-growth promotion .

## 1.3 Identify and implement measures to foster stewardship of antibiotics in animals.

Sub-Objective 1.3.1: Develop, implement, and measure the effectiveness of evidencebased educational outreach to veterinarians and animal producers to advance antibiotic stewardship and judicious use of antibiotics in agricultural settings .

## Milestones

## Within one year:

- · FDA and USDA will consult with livestock and veterinary organizations on the development of educational outreach materials on judicious use of antibiotics and antibiotic stewardship, and

- will meet with the American Veterinary Medical Association and the American Association of Veterinary Medical Colleges to consider the incorporation of additional material on antibiotic resistance and antibiotic stewardship into the curricula of U .S . veterinary colleges .
- · USDA will conduct assessments in various animal production and veterinary settings to identify priority areas in which research is needed to support the development and validation of stewardship activities to assure judicious antibiotic use .
- · USDA will solicit applications to the USDA Antimicrobial Resistance Initiative Program, which aims to advance development and use of antibiotic stewardship practices that assure judicious use of antibiotics in agriculture . Applicants may propose a combination of activities, including research studies and development of educational and outreach materials .  Projected outcomes of the educational and outreach activities include better preparation of the next generation of veterinarians and laboratory scientists .  Projected outcomes of the research activities include development of sustainable strategies to mitigate antibiotic resistance (see Objective 4) .

## Within 3 years:

- · USDA will support the distribution of educational and outreach materials on antibiotic stewardship and judicious use of antibiotics that target veterinarians, producers, educators, and consumers .  These activities will be accomplished through the Antimicrobial Resistance Initiative awardees whose integrated projects are linked to the Cooperative Extension System for education and extension/outreach activities .

Sub-Objective 1.3.2: Foster collaborations and public-private partnerships with public health, pharmaceutical, and agricultural stakeholders to facilitate identification and implementation of interventions (e .g ., good husbandry practices) to reduce the spread of antibiotic-resistance .

## Milestones

## Within one year:

- · FDA and USDA will identify priority areas for research to develop and validate stewardship activities to reduce the spread of antibiotic-resistance .
- · FDA and USDA will work with livestock and veterinary organizations to consider ways to develop, update, and incorporate assessments of antibiotic stewardship activities into quality assurance programs .

## Within three years:

- · FDA and USDA will support applied research in field settings to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of stewardship programs and test and validate alternatives to traditional uses of antibiotics in agriculture .

## Within five years:

- · FDA and USDA will identify validated interventions to reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance and work with public and private sector partners to incorporate them into veterinary practice .

Sub-Objective 1.3.3: Identify, develop, and revise key agricultural practices that allow timely and effective implementation of interventions that improve animal health and efficient production .

## Milestones

## Within three years:

- · FDA and USDA will support drivers-of-change studies to determine which stewardship materials and educational approaches are most effective in improving antibiotic use practices .

Sub-Objective 1.3.4: Develop appropriate metrics to gauge the success of stewardship efforts and guide their continued evolution and optimization .

## Milestones

## Within three years:

- · FDA and USDA will:
- -Collect additional data regarding antibiotic use and resistance in food-producing animals . These data will supplement existing surveillance data used to evaluate the impact of GFI #213 on use practices and resistance trends over time .
- -Measure changes in antibiotic stewardship programs and practices as part of quality assurance programs in cattle operations and swine and broiler chicken production .
- -Use baseline data from the National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS), where available, to evaluate changes over a 5-year time horizon .

- -Promoting New and Next Generation Antibiotics and Diagnostics
- · Provisions in PCAST Recommendations #5 and #6 that concern:
- -International collaboration to promote diagnostic development
- -Prizes for the development of breakthrough diagnostics

Today's researchers are taking advantage of new technologies to develop rapid  'point-of-need' diagnostic tests that can be used during a healthcare visit to distinguish between viral and bacterial infections and identify bacterial drug susceptibilities-an innovation that could significantly reduce unnecessary antibiotic use .  The availability of new rapid diagnostic tests, combined with ongoing use of culturebased assays to identify new resistance mechanisms, will advance the detection and control of resistant bacteria, including the priority pathogens listed in Table 1 .

By 2020, significant outcomes of Goal 3 will include:

## 3.2 Expand the availability and use of diagnostics to improve treatment of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, enhance infection control, and facilitate outbreak detection and response in healthcare and community settings.

FDA and CMS are working with industry partners to streamline development and uptake of new diagnostic tests and facilitate their use to improve patient treatment and achieve public health goals .  A major aim of these efforts is to develop well-defined reimbursement policies and incentives that encourage routine use of diagnostics in clinical settings to distinguish between bacterial and viral infections and identify the antibiotic susceptibilities of bacteria .

FDA and CMS signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on June 18, 2010 that facilitates interagency efforts to streamline regulatory processes in ways that reduce costs and timelines .  New projects include the FDA-CMS Parallel Review , a pilot program that permits concurrent (rather than sequential) product reviews by FDA and CMS (i .e ., while FDA reviews pre-market submissions for approval or clearance of diagnostic tests, CMS determines whether the tests will be covered by Medicare) .  Other projects designed to facilitate innovation include:

- · FDA Entrepreneur in Residence Program, which provides technical support to small businesses who may lack the expertise to navigate the FDA approval or clearance process .
- · FDA Medical Device Innovation Consortium, a partnership between a nonprofit organization and FDA to advance medical device regulatory science .  Members include representatives of organizations involved in:
- -Medical and/or medical device research, development, treatment, or education
- -Promotion of public health

## TABLE 3: CDC's Antibiotic-Resistant Threats in the United States, 2013

## URGENT Threat Level Pathogens (3)

## Clostridium difficile

250,000 infections per year requiring hospitalization or affecting hospitalized patients .

14,000 deaths per year .

At least $1 Billion in excess medical costs per year .

C. difficile deaths increased 400% between 2000-2007 because of the emergence of a strain resistant to a common antibiotic class (fluoroquinolones) .

Almost half of infections occur in people younger than 65, but more than 90% of deaths occur in people 65 and older .

Half of C. difficile i nfections first show symptoms in hospitalized or recently hospitalized patients, and half show symptoms in nursing home patients or in people recently cared for in doctors' offices and clinics who received antibiotics .

The majority (71%) of pediatric Clostridium difficile infections, which are bacterial infections that cause severe diarrhea and are potentially life-threatening, occur among children in the general community, 73% were found to have recently taken antibiotics prescribed in doctor's offices for other outpatient settings .⁶

## Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae *

Out of ~140,000 healthcare-associated Enterobacteriaceae infections per year, more than 9,000 are caused by CRE (7,900 CR-Klebsiella sp p; 1,400 CR-E . coli .) .

Out of ~140,000 healthcare-associated Enterobacteriaceae infections per year, more than 9,000 are caused by CRE (7,900 CR-Klebsiella sp p; 1,400 CR-E . coli .) .

44 States have had at least one type of CRE confirmed by CDC testing .

CRE are resistant to nearly all antibiotics including carbapenems-the antibiotic of last resort .

## Neisseria gonorrhoeae * (Notifiable to CDC)

Neisseria gonorrhoeae ca uses gonorrhea, is the second most common reportable infection in the United States, and is developing resistance to the cephalosporin antibiotics, the last line treatment option for this infection .

Of the 820,000 cases per year, 30% (246,000) now demonstrate resistance to at least one antibiotic .

If cephalosporin-resistant N. gonorrhoeae becomes widespread, the public health impact during a 10-year period is estimated to be 75,000 additional cases of pelvic inflammatory disease, 15,000 cases of epididymitis, and 222 additional HIV infections, with an estimated direct medical cost of at least $235 million .

## SERIOUS Threat Level Pathogens (12)

## Multidrug-Resistant Acinetobacter

12,000 healthcare-associated Acinetobacter infections occur in the U .S . of which 7,000 are multidrug-resistant

- ~ 500 deaths per year .

At least three different classes of antibiotics no longer cure resistant Acinetobacter infections .

## Drug-Resistant Campylobacter

Campylobacter causes ~1 .3 Million infections, 13, 000 hospitalizations and 120 deaths each year; 310,000 (25%) drugresistant Campylobacter infections are found each year .

Campylobacter drug resistance increased from 13% in 1997 to 25% in 2011 .

Campylobacter spreads from animals to people through contaminated food, particularly raw or undercooked chicken and unpasteurized milk .

Antibiotic use in food animals can results in resistant Campylobacter than can spread to humans .

## Fluconazole-Resistant Candida

Out of 46,000 Candida yeast infections per year, 3,400 (30%) of patients with bloodstream infections with drug-resistant (DR)-Candida die during their hospitalization .

CDC estimates that each case of Candida infection results in 3-13 days of additional hospitalization and a total of $6,000$29,000 in direct healthcare costs per patient .
