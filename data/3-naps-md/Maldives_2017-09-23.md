## Foreword

am honoured to share the first national action plan for the containment of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the Maldives. Despite limited resources and geographical challenges in reaching the entire population; Maldives was among the first nations to embrace the global action plan on AMR in 2015 at the 68th World Health Assembly.

To address this global health crisis nationally, a National committee on AMR was commissioned in early 2016. Further to this, a situation analysis was conducted in 2016 to fully comprehend the current the situation analysis provide a snapshot of the areas that require strengthening to successfully tackle antimicrobial resistance in the country .

The National   Action Plan on Antimicrobial  Resistance (NAP AMR) five strategic objectives identified through the situation analysis. These five objectives focus on improving public knowledge and awareness on AMR; development of a sustainable surveillance system on the emergence and and control   within healthcare   settings, food production as well as within the community; rational use of antimicrobials through antimicrobial evidence based and cost effective AMR control measures through research activities.  Within these focus areas; specific objectives that define interventions and activities to accomplish the of NAP through the period of 2017 to 2022. key goals

Addressing antimicrobial resistance in Maldives is a priority of the government and [ believe NAP AMR will be the roadmap to foster coordinated nationwide efforts to combat AMR in the country . With the implementation of this plan, I hope that the emergence of resistance can be lowered and by the end 2022 and Maldives remains a GAP AMR compliant; role model country in the SEAR top region.

## Executive Summary

Maldives has made significant strides in the area of infectious disease prevention and control. This is exemplified by elimination of malaria from Maldives in 2015 and successes in TB control.  In  addition,  Maldives  is  a  front  runner  in  infectious  disease  prevention  through successful water, sanitation, hygiene and vaccination campaigns and coverage.

However, given the limited evidence that exists with respect to the occurrence of resistant organisms  in  the  nation,  it  is  hard  to  estimate  the  exact  antimicrobial  resistance  (AMR) scenario. Also, it becomes difficult to compare the current situation with other countries in the  region.  Moreover,  limited  evidence  exists  on  the  trends  of  use  of  antimicrobial  agents (AMA)  in  Maldives.  Although,  recent  prescription audits have  indicated overuse  of antibiotics, especially for common conditions such as flu, cough and fever.

Meanwhile, several key steps have been taken by the Government of Maldives that have been instrumental in paving the way for the country to join other nations in the South East Asia Region (SEAR) to speed up its plan on addressing the AMR crisis. Combating AMR would therefore  require  the  highest  political  commitment  in  addition  to,  strong  multi-sectoral coordination, sustained investment and technical assistance.

A  Situation  Analysis  was  undertaken  in  August  2016  using  a  tool  developed  by  WHO SEARO  based on discussions between National Multi-sectoral AMR  Coordination Committee  members,  senior  technical  leaders  of  the  national  health  authorities  and  the veterinary sector and the WHO  team. It identified opportunities, challenges and implementation gaps to improve implementation of National Action Plan on Anti-Microbial Resistance  (NAP  AMR)  in  ways  that  can  meet  the  68th  World  Health  Assembly  (WHA) resolution on AMR.

The  indicators  in  the  Situation  Analysis  protocol  were  grouped  under  the  heads  of  the National  AMR  Action  Plan  in  line  with  GAP-AMR;  National  AMR  surveillance  system; Antimicrobial  Stewardship  and  Surveillance  of  antimicrobial  use;  Infection  Prevention Control  in  healthcare  settings;  Awareness  raising;  Research  &amp;  Innovation  and  One-Health engagement. Each of these focus areas were consistent with the five strategic objectives of the  WHO  GAP-AMR.  They  were  further  analysed  along  the  five  phases  of  programme implementation, namely exploration and adoption; programme installation; initial implementation; full operation and sustainable operation.

Key findings from the Situation Analysis revealed a fair amount of commitment among the political and technical leadership of the country. It was also found that they supported AMR containment  efforts,  evidenced  through  the  formation  of  a  National  Multi-sectoral  AMR Coordination Committee. A fully functional national drug regulatory authority had been set up to oversee regulation and licensing, pharmacovigilance and market authorisation. These efforts  clearly  stood  out  as  strong  elements  that  had  potential  to  be  leveraged  as  building blocks of an effective NAP AMR. Similarly, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WaSH) related initiatives in human health along with high vaccination coverage were found to be significant infection  control  mechanisms  within  community  settings.  Finally,  limited  infection  control

initiatives  in  healthcare  institutions  were  seen  as  opportunities  to  leverage  for  instituting effective AMR containment measures in Maldives.

The Situation  Analysis  threw  light  on  initiatives  that  are  being  taken  to  develop  and  draft national  standards  and  guidelines,  such  as  the  national  drug  policies,  updated  essential medicines lists and standard treatment guidelines, including for antibiotic prescription.

Traditionally, lack of animal  populations  and  commercial  orientation  of  food  animal production systems based on terrestrial animals has led to limited development and capacity of  veterinary  health  services.  Accordingly,  majority  of  the  food  consumed  in  Maldives  is imported  into  the country. Recently,  the Government  of  Maldives  laid  emphasis  on diversification  into  poultry  and  goat  farming  as  well  as  aquaculture  with  the  objective  of attaining  greater food security. This calls for  greater attention to the problem of AMR and antimicrobial use (AMU) in veterinary sector. As of now, the animal health sector in general lags behind in AMR containment efforts.

The  National  Action  Plan  on  AMR  for  the  period  2017  -  2022  takes  the  current  efforts further, reinforcing the government's commitment to make universal healthcare and animal welfare, food security a reality. Based on implementation of the five strategic objectives, each of which has its specific objectives, strategic interventions and key activities, the NAP AMR charts a new  phase  in Maldives'  journey  towards  achieving goals related to AMR compliance.

To implement strategic objective 1 related to bridging knowledge and awareness gaps, NAP AMR will establish an evidence-based public communications programme on a national scale to improve awareness of AMR amongst general public and professionals. By the year 2022, the  country  would  have  carried  out  nationwide  evidence-based  awareness  campaigns  with regular  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&amp;E).  Further,  necessary  revision  and  pilot  scale implementation of curricular revisions for professional groups to improve knowledge among them would also have been undertaken by 2022.

To implement strategic objective 2 related to surveillance of AMR, steps would be taken to understand  how  resistance  develops  and  spreads.  This  will  be  done  by  establishing  a nationwide AMR surveillance system along with a national early warning system to identify early the emergence of resistance in priority pathogens and to critical antimicrobials by 2022.

To implement strategic objective 3 related to strengthening of hygiene, infection prevention and control, a national infection prevention and control programme would be implemented in compliance  with  Infection  Prevention  and  Control  (IPC)  guidelines  within  healthcare settings,  and  in  the  emerging  animal  husbandry  systems  and  food  production  systems including  aquaculture.  Also,  actions  to  decrease  Hospital  Associated  Infection  (HAI)  and associated AMR through facility based HAI surveillance programme (Human Health) would be conducted. Hygiene and sanitation related campaigns in community settings are strength in human health sector. This will be consolidated and lessons passed on to the animal sector including emerging food production systems.

To implement strategic  objective  4  related  to  optimising  use  of  antimicrobial  medicines,  a national AMR containment policy would be announced along with a series of measures on Antimicrobial Stewardship Programmes (AMSP) and Standard Treatment Guidelines (STG) at the national scale to promote prudent use of antimicrobials. Moreover, mechanisms would be established to monitor antimicrobial usage on a national scale to inform interventions to reduce overuse and promote prudent use of antimicrobial substances. Regulatory structures will be strengthened with special emphasis on import control.

To implement strategic objective 5 related to building a case for sustainable investments for new medicines, diagnostic tools/vaccines/aids that help bring down use of AMR; it is being mooted to build institutional capacity in the context of research on AMR. A strategic research agenda that is relevant to the Maldives context will be developed and implemented. This will be done in large part, through leveraging  existing capacity, building additional capacity as well as developing international collaborations.

Most of these activities will be implemented by the key actors as outlined in the proposed strategic plan that covers the period 2017-22. Following submission of the final report to the World  Health  Assembly  (WHA),  the  Government  of  Maldives  will  continue  with  its deliberations and planning process under the leadership of a National Multi-Sectoral Steering Committee (NMSC).

## Background

## Setting the Context: From Global to National Action Plans

One of the biggest concerns in the public health domain today relates to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Governments across the globe are striving to estimate the crisis in their nation states and the kind of impact it is having on both human and animal life.  At the 68th World Health Assembly (WHA) in May 2015, a global action plan on AMR (GAP AMR) was adopted in response to the acknowledgment of this emerging crisis (1). The GAP AMR has therefore been developed at the request of the Health Assembly in keeping with resolution WHA67.25 of May 2014, which was reflective of the global consensus that AMR was indeed a serious threat to human health.

The GAP AMR has advocated for the One Health approach to form the basis for the global response to AMR, especially in the case of developing countries, which are expected to contribute to the increasing trends of antimicrobial agent (AMA) consumption and therefore, likely to be at  higher risk of emerging resistant microbes (2-4). The need for this was further stressed at the 2015 WHA through resolution WHA68.7.

Consolidating the position of the GAP AMR, the global political will come together to further commit to the cause of containment of AMR at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) at the high-level meeting on AMR on 21 September 2016, in New York (5). At this meeting, global leaders committed to 'taking a broad, coordinated approach to address the root causes of AMR across multiple sectors, especially in human health, animal health and agriculture' (5).

One of the overarching requirements outlined by the GAP AMR was that all Member States (MS) should develop their own, tailor-made National Action Plans on AMR (NAP AMR), duly aligned with the principles and approaches espoused by the GAP AMR by May 2017. Framing a contextually-driven NAP AMR will provide a baseline understanding of the local AMR situation, along with highlighting gaps and available capacities. This will serve as valuable information, allowing different countries to customize their NAP AMR as per their local realities. Prior to embarking on conducting the Situation Analysis for Maldives, an effort was made to understand its unique geographical location as also the quality and reach of its public health system and the burden of infectious disease.  The island nation of Maldives has a population of about 364,000 people, of which almost 65% reside in rural areas, according to the population and housing census of 2015(6).The Maldivian nation is made up of 1192 coral islands in the Indian Ocean. These islands are made up of 26 natural atolls spreading approximately 860 km long and 480 km wide. The Maldivian Exclusive Economic Zone covers about 90000 km2. Land area is estimated to cover only about 300 km2 and some 80% of the total landmass lie a mere one meter above mean sea level. The North-East monsoon from December to February and the South-West monsoon from May to September is the main characteristic of the humid tropical climate of Maldives (7).

The health system in Maldives is characterized by dominant expatriate health workforce, limited institutional capacity and total import based medical supplies including AMAs. Yet, with total health expenditure as the share of GDP being 13.7%, Maldives is a front runner in improved health outcomes in SEA region. This is exemplified by 99% Relative inequality

P a g e  10 | 63

score for reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health intervention coverage, which is highest in the region, and &gt;60% UHC coverage index of essential health services.

In  the  area  of  infectious  diseases  prevention  and  control,  Maldives  has  made  significant strides. The DPT3 coverage in the country is nearly (8). 99% of the population uses improved drinking  water  sources  and  98%  population  uses  improved  sanitation  (8).  Malaria  was declared eliminated from Maldives in 2015 (9). Maldives reports the lowest incidence rate of all  forms  of  TB  (53/100,00  population  per  year)  and  mortality  due  to  TB  (5.4/100,000 population  per  year)  in  SEA  region.  MDR-TB  incidence  in  Maldives  is  also  among  the lowest in the region. However,  in  case  of general bacterial pathogens,  no  data on antimicrobial resistance or prevalence is available in the country and hence the impact of the situation is not evaluated, even though it is commonly accepted that there is resistance among the microbial population (10)

## Situation Analysis and Assessment

The process of framing a NAP AMR for Maldives was initiated through a Situation Analysis, which provided details of the existing AMR situation, gaps and capacity in the local context.

## Antimicrobial resistance and use in human health sector

While TB prevention and control, including multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), is a success story in Maldives, in the absence of AMR surveillance and evidence, the same cannot be said about AMR in general pathogens. In an update to WHO, limited data on AMR from Indira  Gandhi      Memorial  Hospital  (IGMH)  Lab  information  system  from  2007  to  2009, reportedly indicated rising trend of AMR  in  common  pathogens. Three organisms (Escherichia  coli,  Staphylococcus  aureus,  and  Klebsiella  species)  commonly  isolated  were selected along with the antibiotics tested for them. Over 70% is resistance to Ampicillin and Amoxicillin  in  all  organisms.  Amikacin  showed  less  than  3%  resistance  to  E.coli  and Klebsiella.  The  resistance  of  Klebsiella  to  all  antibiotics  was  found  to  be  much  more compared to that of E.coli(11).  In  another update to WHO, similar findings emerged from IGMH  data.  Ampicillin  resistance  has  increased  over  the  years,  but  co-amoxiclav  and Amikacin  still  have  a  good  sensitivity.  Commonly  isolated  organisms  include  Escherichia coli, Staph aureus, and Pseudomonas sp. The methicillin-resistant

Staphylococcus  aureus  (MRSA)  isolation  has  been  very  low,  with  only  one  or  two  cases being reported each year (12). These data are however too unstructured and limited to make any comparison or inference on the overall situation of AMR in Maldives.

Limited  evidence  also  exists  on  the  trends  of  use  of  AMAs  in  Maldives.  In  2011,  a prescription  audit was undertaken to evaluate the prescription and consumption patterns of antibiotics. The result showed that 40% of prescriptions contained an antibiotic and 22% is prescribed for flu, cough, and fever. The most frequent antibiotic prescribed was Augmentin. It  was  recommended  that  prescription  audits,  together  with  data  on  communicable  disease surveillance and import of antibiotics to the country could form the basis for the development of an intensive antimicrobial resistance and use surveillance in the country.

Subsequently,  the  country  undertook  further  prescription  audit  for  antibiotic  use,  and developed media campaigns, audio spots and video spots as well as pamphlets, leaflets and posters and disseminated to the public, prescribers, and pharmacists.

## AMR and AMU in animals and livestock sector

## Livestock sector

Maldives is a country without cows or buffalo. However, goat and poultry production are two growing  economic  activities  for  outlying  island  communities.  Goats  are  in  demand  for cultural events while eggs are popular throughout the country and especially among the 100 plus high-end resort islands. Animal production is limited to small scale rearing of chicken and  goats  in  the  backyards.  Chicken  farming  in  cages  contained  free-range  and  backyard poultry is practiced  widely throughout the country. Most of the households own about 6-8 chicken. For chicken farming, feeding materials are imported and production costs are high. In 2010, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in collaboration with the United Nations Development  Programme  (UNDP)  provided  support  to  develop  poultry  production  in  two islands.  The  success  of  this  activity  has  resulted  in  a  government  plan  to  expand  egg production  to  a  number  of  other  islands  because  it  generates  income  for  the  people  while reducing the country's dependency on imported eggs (7,13).

The demand for goats exceeds supply. The shortage of available land limits the expansion of goat  production,  although  feed  can  be  supplied  from  materials  available  in  roadside  live fences, the undercover of forest lands and lands cultivated with perennial crops. There is also a potential for supplying goat milk and cottage cheese production. Goat milk is a traditional drink which is considered to be nutritious and would be a good option for responding to the poor nutrition of children of schooling ages (7,13,14).

## Fisheries and aquaculture

The  Maldivian  economy  has  for  centuries  been  entirely  dependent  on  fisheries  and  other marine products  and  fishing  and  related  marine  activities  continue  to  employ  a  significant proportion of the population. Resultantly, the government gives priority to the development of the fisheries sector, which at present contributes over 15% of its gross domestic product (GDP). About 30% of the country's workforce is engaged in the fisheries sector which is the second most important sector after tourism. Given its vast marine resources, aquaculture has a limited role to play in the fisheries sector and therefore the use of AMAs for production. However, little evidence exists on the use of AMAs in the post-harvest phase.

## Government efforts to attain greater food security

Maldives currently imports over 90% of its food supplies from abroad and is dependent on forces that are beyond its control. Not surprisingly, one of the main goals of the Government is to reduce  its dependence  on  imported  foods  by  at  least  10%  during  the current government's administration. This will increase food security which is a direct consequence of increased food production. Some of the initiatives that will help to achieve this objective are  by  promoting  and  providing  direct  assistance  to  the  efforts  of  farmers  with  a  view  to

P a g e  12 | 63

attaining  a  high  level  of  diversified  food  production  (15).  Such  efforts  to  increase  food production,  especially  in  the  meat  and  poultry  sector  is  likely  to  increase  the  use  of antibiotics,  as  is  the  case  in  other  settings.  This  will  in  turn  call  for  regulation  and surveillance of AMR and AMU in the livestock and fisheries sectors.

## Situation analysis of AMR containment efforts in Maldives

A Situation Analysis was undertaken in Maldives in August 2016, using a tool developed by WHO SEARO. Specific objectives were:

-  To conduct the Situation Analysis prior to strengthening and developing the National Action  Plan,  aligning  with  Global  Action  Plan  to  determine  the  baseline  regarding implementation  and  functionality  in  terms  of  sufficient  qualified  human  resources, funding and functional structures of command and coordination of AMR program in the country;
-  To identify opportunities, challenges and implementation gaps in order to improve the overall NAP implementation;
-  To assist Maldives in identifying vulnerabilities, opportunities and needs to meet the 68th WHA resolution on AMR and prioritising activities for AMR containment as per NAP;
-  To  facilitate  WHO  in  fulfilling  its  commitment  to  report  on  the  development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the NAP-AMR and to identify priority areas for WHO to support.

The Situation Analysis process comprised of guided discussions between the National AMR Coordination Committee members, senior technical leaders of national health authorities and veterinary sector, and WHO team. It looked at how well developed the AMR program was in terms of governance, policy, and systems. The review focused on broad system-wide analysis rather than assessing the quality of policies and documents.

The  indicators  in  the  Situation  Analysis  protocol  were  grouped  into  seven  focus  areas:  1. National AMR Action Plan in line with GAP-AMR; 2. National AMR surveillance system; 3. Antimicrobial  Stewardship  and  Surveillance  of  antimicrobial  use;  4.  Infection  Prevention Control in healthcare settings; 5. Awareness raising; 6. Research &amp; innovation; and 7. OneHealth engagement. These focus areas were consistent with the five strategic objectives of the WHO GAP-AMR.

Each of the above mentioned focus areas comprised of a list of sub-focus areas and each subfocus area were graded on five levels to show the incremental extent of AMR programme implementation.  These  five  levels  of  phases  included  Phase  1:  Phase  of  exploration  and adoption; Phase 2: Phase of programme installation; Phase 3: Phase of initial implementation; Phase  4:  Phase  of  full  operation;  Phase  5:  Phase  of  sustainable  operation  (16)  (Figure  1) (Annexure 1).

For purpose of clarity and in-depth understanding, a theme-based Situation Analysis process was undertaken, based on the phases in which each of the indicators were placed in. Each of

## the  phases  reflected  phases  of  installation  and  implementation  of  the  AMR  containment

programme in terms of governance, policy and  system. Phases 1 and 2  - relates  to  policy development and planning but no implementation; Phases 3-5 are related to different levels of implementation including  Initial  implementation;  the  phase  of  full  operation;  and  phase  of sustainable operation. It was found that phases 3 to 5 were the backbone or strength of the system.  Sustainable  operation  is  considered  best  practice  and  defined  here  as  an  operation that incorporates the M&amp;E system.

## Figure 1: Phases of programme implementation

Figure  1  shows  the  status  of  implementation  of  AMR  containment  program  in  Maldives. Green color indicates complete implementation; yellow indicates partial implementation and red  implies  no  implementation.  Following  were  the  findings  from  the  Government  of Maldives-WHO Situational Analysis:

## National AMR Action Plan in line with GAP-AMR

Maldives  have  started  initial  work  for  developing  a  National  Action  Plan  for  AMR containment.  A  national  multi-sectoral  AMR  coordination  committee  has  been  announced with the Director General of Maldives Food and Drug Authority (MFDA) identified as the National  Focal  Point.  Further,  governance  mechanisms  to  implement  plans  under  different strategic objectives and interventions will be developed as part of the NAP AMR.

## Awareness raising

The Situation Analysis in Maldives revealed that awareness campaigns on AMR have only recently been initiated. With the support of WHO Country Office, the MFDA coordinated a series of awareness activities during the AMR awareness week in 2015 and 2016. This was done by mainly targeting the general public including schools, but also reaching out to the executive committee of Minister of Health, clinicians in public and private hospitals, nurses, pharmacists, allied health professionals and government officials in health and other sectors. Awareness in livestock and fisheries sector including farmers is yet to be planned and conducted.

Maldives's health system is characterized by a substantial presence of expatriate doctors. In the absence of medical schools in the country, doctors of Maldivian origin are trained outside of  the  country.  This  does  not  provide  an  opportunity  for  curricular  level  interventions  but leaves a scope for continuous professional development related to AMR and related issues. Similarly, in the absence of veterinary schools and veterinarians, there are only opportunities

P a g e  14 | 63

for  continuing  education  in  the  veterinary  sector.  MFDA  has  recently  collaborated  with Ministry of Education (MoE) and Maldives National University (MNU) to submit Terms of Reference  to  WHO  Country  Office  for  technical  support  for  curriculum  development  on AMR and related issues for grades 1-12 in schools as well as professional groups (nurses, allied  health  professionals,  lab  technologists).  Under  Ministry  of  Education,  the  National Institute of Education (NIE) and MNU/FHS are responsible for curriculum development for schools and health services in humans respectively.

## National AMR surveillance system

An  AMR  surveillance  system  that  captures  standardized  epidemiological,  clinical  and laboratory  data  on  AMR  has  not  been  set  up  in  Maldives.  In  the  public  sector,  clinical diagnostic services are provided through a four-tiered system of the tertiary hospital (IGMH), regional  hospitals,  Atoll  Hospitals  (Levels  1-3)  and  Health  Centres  (Level  3-1).  Bacterial culture and sensitivity testing are carried out in IGMH and all Regional and Atoll Hospitals in Maldives.  At  peripheral  levels,  clinical  samples  could  be  sent  to  hospitals  for  antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST), through clinical sample transport mechanisms. IGMH additionally carries out  blood  and  CSF  culture  and  sensitivity.  Bacterial  culture  and sensitivity facility is also available at ADK Hospital, a private tertiary care hospital.

A system of internal quality control and standardized testing is however practiced at IGMH. IGMH  has  also  started  participating  in  Thailand  External  Quality  Assessment  Scheme (EQAS) for SEAR and along with ADK Hospital has recently reached out to CMC Vellore EQAS  Program.  A  recently  conducted  training  on  standardized  bacterial  culture  and sensitivity  testing  and  WHONET  software  have  identified  several  gaps  in  internal  quality control at different levels of facilities carrying out bacterial culture and sensitivity.

Data is maintained mostly in paper-based format hospital laboratories without any system of reporting to the higher level or feedback to lower level. Data comprises of isolates and their AST results without any epidemiological information. A national referral laboratory for AMR surveillance is yet to be identified.

In the absence of systematic data collection and analysis of AMR trends, an early warning system  for  emerging  trends  drug  resistance  trends  is  not  operational  in  Maldives.  The Situation Analysis revealed some anecdotal evidence of hospital-level analysis on a case-tocase basis following identification of unusual resistance patterns or in the event of a hospital outbreak.

A National Health Laboratory, Male' under the MFDA undertakes food testing for imported food products, water samples, and pharmaceuticals. The National Health Laboratory (NHL), Male' is equipped with sophisticated equipment such as High-Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) for residue testing. Testing for antibiotic residues in imported food and quality of imported antibiotics is however limited and ad hoc.

Epidemiological surveillance of communicable diseases, apart from vertical disease control programs, is carried out by Health protection Agency (HPA) of Ministry of Health (MoH). Close to 18 notifiable diseases are reported daily from all healthcare facilities through a web-

P a g e  15 | 63

based  reporting  system.  Laboratory  support  is  sought  on  a  case-to-case  basis  but  the surveillance  system  is  not  adapted  to  capture  AMR  data.  There  is  no  linkage  of  HPAs Communicable Diseases surveillance with surveillance of HAIs.

## Antimicrobial Stewardship, drug regulation and surveillance of antimicrobial use

Medicines including AMAs used in Maldives are imported with no local production; major sources being India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Malaysia. Import, distribution and sale including over-the-counter (OTC) sales are regulated by MFDA, a fully functional and strong national drug regulatory authority. The MFDA is also responsible for the regulation of food imports and exports. National Health Laboratory (NHL) of the MFDA is responsible for providing laboratory  support  for  chemical  and  microbiological  standards  testing.  However,  limited human and technical capacity exists at NHL for testing the quality of imported medicines and food at  the  points  of  entry,  although  a  system  for  post-marketing  surveillance  system  is  in place  under  MFDA  for  both  imported  medicines  and  food.  Inspection  of  OTC  sales  by MFDA is carried out systematically and regularly 1-2 times a year covering all public and private pharmacies in the country. Inspections are carried out through its own system and in collaboration  with  Public  Health  Units  of  MoH  in  smaller  and  difficult  to  reach  islands. Recently approved Health Services Bill 2016 though its Medicines Chapter has resulted in a major shift in the regulatory powers of MFDA wherein the Authority has been empowered with penal powers in case of violation.  A recent survey of OTC sales of prescription only medicines including AMAs conducted by MFDA in 2015 revealed 25% pharmacies violating the regulatory provisions (personal communication from MFDA) and indicates presence of irrational use and violation in spite of a rigorous monitoring system.

STO which is an autonomous and the main agency that procures medicines including AMAs and through its nationwide network of distribution system, it provides medicines to hospitals and pharmacies under its network. At least one pharmacy is operational in each of the islands. The  private  importers  are  significant  operators  in  the  medicines  market  in  Maldives. Approved drug lists for human and animal medicines, has both registered and pre-authorised medicines in the lists, and is characterised by relaxed criteria for import permission. Import criteria such as good manufacturing practices (GMP) certification, is further relaxed as in the case of 'critical' situations such as supply shortages and stock out situations. Limited size of the Maldivian market does not allow the MFDA to negotiate with manufacturers and enforce mandatory criteria for registration of unregistered drugs in the approved list. Consolidation and bulk purchase by STO has recently been proposed as one of the mechanisms to enforce compliance.

The  AMSP  as  an  important  strategy  for  monitoring  and  improving  the  use  of  AMAs  in different health care settings is yet to be introduced in Maldives's health sector. Notably, the National  STG  is  in  the  process  of  being  drafted  by  the  MoH.  Currently,  the  treatment guidelines,  including  use  of  AMAs,  is  guided  by  empirical  evidence  and  adapted  by  local physicians  and  surgeons  in  hospitals.  Local  STGs  are  seldom  guided  by  local  AMR surveillance data.

P a g e  16 | 63

Surveillance for AMU  is  not  operationalized in Maldives. Import data provides an opportunity to monitor their use through sales data which is mostly not analysed. Similarly, surveillance for use in hospital and ambulatory care settings has not been operationalized. A recent proposal by the Quality Assurance and Regulation Division recommends a review of at  least  one  month's  antibiotics  prescription  on  acute  respiratory  tract  infections  and  viral fevers  from  healthcare  facilities  that  can  be  conducted  twice  a  year.  The  objective  is  to understand the nature and extent of AMU by facilities and departments and provide feedback as well as report to insurance agencies when processing claims.

## Infection Prevention Control in healthcare settings

Infection  control  and  patient  safety  policy  were  introduced  in  healthcare  settings  by  MoH some years ago. Infection control committees (ICC) and teams are in place under the policy with infection control guidelines. However, except for limited activities related to education and  training  in  hand  hygiene,  standard  precautions  and  additional  (transmission  related) precautions,  there  is  the  limited  activity  of  ICCs.  The  quality  of  microbiology  laboratory testing is not assured except the recent subscription of IGMH to Thailand EQAS. No analysis of  hospital-associated  infections  data,  AMR  surveillance  and  AMU  data  is  conducted  to prevent  infections  and  improve  AMAs.  Recently,  safe  disposal  of  hospital  waste  has  been disrupted  in  both  public  and  private  health  care  facilities.  Resource  constraints  including human resource constraints and lack of standards and guidelines are often cited as the reasons for  IPC  programs  not  being  implemented  to  their  fullest  potential.  As  part  of  its  effort  to achieve  National  Accreditation  Board  for  Hospitals  and  Healthcare  Providers  (NABH) Accreditation, ADK Hospital - the largest private hospital in the country is in the process of setting up an Infection Control and AMSP at the facility level. Some of the features in place include  infection  control  committee,  infection  control  guidelines,  surveillance  for  HAIs, AMR  surveillance, feedback to clinicians on AMR  trends. Prescription audits and surveillance of use are yet to be established as the standard component.

The recently drafted National Health Care Quality Standards by the Quality Assurance and Regulation Division of MoH will be published in April 2017. The Standards will include a list  of  625  criteria  that  cover  different  quality  aspects  of  health  care  delivery  in  acute  care facilities throughout the country. The list includes criteria for licensing as well as voluntary accreditation  and  includes  laboratory  standards,  infection  control,  and  patient  safety  as  an essential domain. Standards for AST, however, have not been included in the list.

## Research &amp; innovation

In spite of modest institutional capacity, public health research in general and AMR research specifically has not caught the attention of the research community as it is reflected in limited peer-reviewed  publication  base  from  Maldives.  Even  opportunistic  research  in  clinical settings to fulfil mandatory academic requirements is not conducted, as health care facilities are not academic institutions. No international collaborations have been established on AMR or  related  research.  Maldives  has  a  National  Health  Research  Committee  (NHRC)  that

P a g e  17 | 63

reviews proposals for health research in the country. However, a strategic research agenda and priorities for health research in Maldives are yet to be identified.

## One-Health engagement

Maldives  has  traditionally  lacked  animal  populations  and  commercial  orientation  of  food animal production systems based on terrestrial animals. The focus of agriculture sector has predominantly been on fisheries (wild fish). This has led to limited development and capacity of veterinary health services. Recent diversification into poultry and goat farming as well as aquaculture have raised the possibility of AMU and AMR and need for strengthening efforts in that sector.

The animal health sector in general lags further behind in AMR containment efforts. AMR containment  policy,  AMR  surveillance,  AMSP  and  awareness  programs  have  not  been initiated.  Guidelines  have  been  developed  on  poultry  production,  goat  farming,  biosecurity and  hygiene  related  interventions.  However,  in  the  absence  of  animal  extension  services guidelines  are  not  adequately  disseminated  and  practiced.  There  are  veterinarians  or  paraveterinarians  or  capacity  building  opportunities  through  university  system  in  Maldives. Ministry  of  Fisheries  and  Agriculture  (MoFA)  is  dependent  on  NHL  for  testing  of  food, especially for residues.

One of the major constraints in controlling AMU in a veterinary sector has been the absence of regulatory control of veterinary sector on licensing, regulating and controlling AMAs.  The veterinary  sector  is  only  mandated  to  recommend  AMAs  for  the  approved  drug  list requisitioned  by  animal  production  units.  The  regulatory  control  by  MFDA  at  MoH  lacks effectiveness at the field level.

Overall, AMR containment efforts in Maldives are in the phase of exploration and adoption in different focus areas with initial implementation in awareness and hygiene/sanitation; drug regulation is in process of achieving full operation (Figure 2).

## National Action Plan on AMR (2016 - 2020)

## Goal, Objectives and Guiding Principles

The process of developing the NAP-AMR for Maldives was initiated by first spelling out the goal of the GAP AMR. At all times, effort was made to: 'to ensure, for as long as possible, continuity  of  successful  treatment  and  prevention  of  infectious  diseases  with  effective  and safe medicines that are quality-assured, used in a responsible way, and accessible to all who need them.'

To achieve this, the GAP-AMR laid down five strategic objectives which form the basis for developing  public  health  response  to  AMR  globally  and  to  Maldives  in  particular.  These strategic objectives are:

- Objective  1: Improve  awareness  and  understanding  of  antimicrobial  resistance through effective communication, education and training
- Objective 2: Strengthen the knowledge and evidence base through surveillance and research
- Objective 3: Reduce the incidence of infection through effective sanitation, hygiene and infection prevention measures
- Objective 4: Optimise use of antimicrobial medicines in human and animal health
- Objective 5: Develop the economic case for sustainable investment that takes account of the needs of all countries, and increase investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions

Additionally,  the  NAP  AMR  is  expected  to  reflect  the  five  principles  based  on  which  the GAP AMR strategies  have  been  enunciated.  These  include:  Whole-of-society  engagement including  a  One  Health  approach,  Prevention  first,  Access,  Sustainability,  and  Incremental targets for implementation (17).

## NAP Development Process

The development of NAP has followed the guidelines enshrined in WHO's 'Antimicrobial resistance: A manual for developing national action plans' (18). The approach is structured around the five strategic objectives and five principles which are embodied by the GAP AMR (17).

Within  the  five  strategic  objectives  of  the  GAP  AMR,  12  specific  objectives  have  been included.  Each  of  these  specific  objectives  has  been  described  in  terms  of  a  Strategic Intervention, with a defined set of key activities to be carried out successfully to execute the strategic  intervention  and  eventually  to  fulfil  the  strategic  objective.  Key  Monitoring  &amp; Evaluation  (M&amp;E)  indicators  have  been  listed  for  activities  under  each  of  the  strategic interventions  with  the  operational  plan  comprising  of  broad  planning  by  activity.  Detailed planning along with the budget allotted for the respective activities will be done in due course by national stakeholders.

The  NAP  thus  consists  of  the  Situation  Analysis  and  Assessment,  a  Strategic  Plan,  an Operational Plan as described in the WHO guidance manual and a Sample template (18,19).

P a g e  20 | 63

The  Situation  Analysis  by  WHO  SEARO  focused  on  how  well  developed  the  AMR programme is in terms of governance, policy and systems formed the basis for identifying gaps and strategic priorities.  It was further supported by a literature review, including grey literature provided by country-level stakeholders.

Based on the extent of implementation, each of the strategic interventions was graded on an incremental scale comprising of five phases adapted from  the Indicator Standards Assessment  Tool  developed  by  UNAIDS  (16).  The  first  phase,  that  of  exploration  and adoption, indicates that the process of designing an AMR containment programme has been initiated. Once the decision to implement the programme has been made, systems progress to the second phase, which is of programme  installation. The third phase, of initial implementation,  is  one  of  the  most  challenging  phases  for  programmes  in  developing countries. Once the early implementation barrier is overcome and the programme is scaledup,  the  fourth  stage  -  full  operation  -  is  achieved.  It  is  only  after  the  programme  starts  to function  at  the  highest  grade  of  operational  efficiency,  that  the  fifth  and  final  stage  of sustainable operation, is attained.

Findings from the Situation Analysis helped situate the current state of NAP in the country along  the  incremental  scale.  To  enable  Maldives  to  make  maximum  progress  towards implementing  NAP,  the  GAP  principle  of  'Incremental  targets  for  implementation'  was followed with the ultimate aim of achieving phase 5 of sustained operations. Flexibility was built into the planning process including monitoring and reporting arrangements, in order to allow the country to determine priority actions that it needs to take in order to attain the five strategic  objectives  and  to  implement  actions  in  a  step-wise  manner  that  meets  both  local needs and global priorities.

The  development  of  NAP  entailed  a  process  of  participative  dialogue  with  important stakeholders and informants. Technical support was provided by WHO Country office, WHO SEARO and the Consultant. Its further, expansion into a detailed operational  plan by subactivities and validation will be done by country teams and stakeholders.

## Country Response

The country response for Maldives will be mounted based on a well-appointed governance mechanism.  Each  of  its  aspects have  been  detailed with clearly assigned roles and responsibilities in the following section.

## Governance

Having a national multi-sectoral governance mechanism will serve as the central intervention around  which  all  the  AMR-related  activities  can  be  effectively  coordinated  in  each  of  the relevant  sectors.  This  will  ensure  a  systematic  and  comprehensive  approach.  However,  the scope should be broad enough to address all five strategic objectives of the global action plan, prioritising activities in a step-wise approach.

The  governance  mechanism  for  Maldives  will  comprise  of  a  High  Level  National  MultiSectoral  Steering  Committee  (NMSC),  for  Antibiotic  Resistances.  The  NMSC  will  be supported by a National AMR  Coordinating  Committee  (NACC)  and  multi-sectoral

## Strategic Plan

While developing the NAP-AMR for Maldives, a strategic plan has been formulated, keeping in mind its geographical aspects as also its public health and other socio-cultural and economic status. The NAP AMR has been based on the implementation of five strategic objectives, each of which has its objectives, strategic interventions and key activities.

## Strategic Objective 1: Awareness

The GAP AMR has identified the need to raise awareness of AMR and promote behavioural change through public communication programmes that target different audiences in human health, animal health and agricultural practices as well as a wide range of consumers related to these sectors. The GAP AMR has also focused on making AMR as a core component of the professional education training, certification, continuing education  and  development  in  the  health  and  veterinary  sectors  and  agricultural  practice.  This  approach  is  expected  to  foster  proper understanding and awareness amongst professionals.

The Situation Analysis in Maldives revealed that awareness campaigns on AMR have recently been initiated with the support of WHO Country Office.  Awareness  campaigns  that  are  led  by  MFDA  target  different  groups  including  general  public  and  professionals  in  health  sector. Awareness in livestock and fisheries sector including farmers is yet to be planned and conducted.

Initial planning is also underway to introduce curricular interventions in schools and allied health services. Continuous professional education for in service professionals in health sector are also being  proposed  and  technical  support  sought.  MoFA  is  yet  to  plan  similar curricular/continuous professional education level interventions.

By  2022,  Maldives  will  carry  out  nationwide  evidence-based  awareness  campaigns  with  regular  M&amp;E.  The  aim  is  also  to  develop/revise curricula in schools, nurses, allied health and veterinary services, and Continuous Professional Development courses. Revised curricula will be implemented on a limited scale but with regular audits. The Strategic Plan is as follows:

## Objective 1.1: To improve awareness of AMR amongst the general public and professionals

Strategic  intervention  1.1  Establish  an  evidence-based  public  communications  programme  targeting  audiences  in  policy  making,  human  and animal health practice, the general public and professionals on prudent use of antimicrobials

## Illustrative Indicators

-  Revised curricula for undergraduate, postgraduate and Continuous Professional Development courses in human and animal health and food industry; and
-  Increased knowledge of AMR and related topics among professionals.

## Strategic Objective 2: Surveillance of Amr

The  GAP  AMR  identifies  the  need  to  establish  evidence  based  surveillance  for  AMR  in  the  nation  and  identifies  the  following  critical information/evidence gaps:

-  Descriptive epidemiology of resistant organisms as they emerge
-  Understanding how resistance develops and spreads
-  The ability to rapidly characterise the emergent resistant organisms
-  Understanding social sciences, behavioural and other research needed for holistic fulfilment of all five strategic objectives
-  Treatment and prevention of infections, especially in the low resource settings
-  Basic and translational research to support the development of new treatments, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions
-  Alternatives to non-therapeutic uses of antimicrobial agents in the context of agriculture, aquaculture and their use in crop protection
-  Economic research

The situation analysis revealed that several elements of systematic AMR surveillance are not in place in different sectors such as surveillance standards/guidelines, laboratory standards, systematic data collection and analysis including electronic reporting, recording and linkage with HAI surveillance. Human health sector is ahead with an institutional level bacterial AST and initial efforts to put quality assurance system in selected  laboratories  performing  AMR  testing.  However,  animal  health  sector  has  no  AMR  surveillance  in  the  emerging  food  animal production systems of poultry, goat farms and aquaculture.

By 2022, Maldives will consolidate its strengths in AMR surveillance and develop a high quality AMR surveillance system on a limited scale  that  will  integrate  AMR  surveillance  in  laboratories,  hospitals,  AMU  and  surveillance  in  animal  sectors.  Sentinel  environmental surveillance  in  high  risk  settings  will  be  established.  By  2022,  a  national  early  warning  system  will  be  in  place  to  identify  early,  the emergence of resistance in priority pathogens and to critical antimicrobials. Nationwide expansion will be planned at the end of this phase of NAP in 2022. The Plan will be rolled out as below:

## Strategic Objective 3: Hygiene, Infection Prevention And Control (Ipc)

Infection prevention and control, especially in the context of hospitals, is an important aspect of a strategic plan to contain AMR since clinical settings  represent  an  ecosystem  of  high  antimicrobial  usage.  Within  this  ecosystem  exists    patients,  who  may  be  immunologically  impaired. These patients not only represent the population that is vulnerable to serious  life-threatening infections and at the same time, they promote the emergence of resistance.

On  the  other  hand,  better  hygiene  (WaSH)  and  Infection  prevention  control  represent  methods  to  cut  down  on  the  spread  of  infections  in ambulatory human and animal care facilities, in food production systems and in the community in general. Vaccination in humans and animals and biosecurity in food production systems are specific interventions that if implemented effectively, can result in better health outcomes and reduced risk of emergence of AMR.

The Situation Analysis of measures related to hygiene, infection prevention and control in human, animal and related sectors in Maldives reveals frameworks that have been developed. However, in the absence of standardised guidelines, awareness, training and resources, the quality and scale of implementation has been less than optimal. Health Care Quality Standards are platforms that could be capitalised. Other measures such as AMR stewardship programme in healthcare settings or ambulatory settings, in human and animal health and food production sectors and HAI surveillance are yet to be initiated.

The Strategic Plan as outlined below aims to roll out a comprehensive multi-sectoral national IPC programme on a limited scale in healthcare facilities in public, private sector and in selected food animal production sector (poultry, goat farms, aquaculture). Similarly, HAI surveillance will  be  implemented  in  few  public  and  private  healthcare  facilities.  In  community  settings,  formal  campaigns  for  sanitation  and  hygiene including biosecurity and animal husbandry practices and food handling practices on a small scale in animal and food animal production sites. Human vaccination programs are well-developed programs that will be further consolidated and animal vaccination strengthened.

Objective 3.1: To establish a national infection prevention and control programme through full implementation and compliance  with the IPC guidelines within healthcare settings, animal husbandry systems, fisheries and the food chain Strategic intervention 3.1 Create a formal organizational structure to ensure proper development , use of infection prevention and control policies and strategies in health care settings, animal rearing facilities and in aquaculture

## Strategic Objective 4: Optimise Use Of Antimicrobial Medicines

Use of antimicrobials in any form, even when rational and prudent, can precipitate resistance in target microbes. High antibiotic use may reflect over-prescription, easy access through over-the-counter sales, and more recently sales via the Internet which are widespread in many countries.

The situation analysis reveals that Maldives has a fully functional National Regulatory Authority that is responsible for regulation and licensing; drug import and pharmacovigilance. Post licensing inspections including for retail pharmacies and OTC sales are carried out on national scale regularly. However, limited human and technical resources as well as the complex challenges of import based system of procurement limit the effectiveness of regulatory activities. Import of AMAs used in food animal production sector including aquaculture is covered by the regulatory framework. The country lacks important instruments and systems such as a National AMR containment policy, AMU surveillance including surveillance of sales of antimicrobial agents. Animal health sector lags on all of the above fronts and is also constrained by lack of regulatory powers.

Maldives  will  establish  a  robust  system  for  regulation  and  surveillance  of  use  of  antimicrobial  agents  for  control  of  use  of  antimicrobial substances in human, animal and food production sectors. Some of the measures taken will include an empowered National Drug Regulatory Authority,  import  frameworks  favourable  to  regulatory  requirements,  National  AMR  Containment  and  Use  Policy  and  related  regulatory frameworks, standard treatment guidelines with special reference to use of antimicrobial agents, National Antimicrobial Stewardship Programme and AMU monitoring programme in human and food animal production systems, ambulatory and community settings and including, residues testing in food products. All of the above systems to optimise use of antimicrobials, however, will be implemented on a limited scale during 2017-2022. Formal assessments will be carried out at the end of this period before nationwide scale up. The Strategic Plan to establish the above is as outlined below:

## Objective 4.1: Establish a national Antimicrobial Stewardship Programme on a national scale to improve and measure the appropriate use of antimicrobials

Strategic intervention 4.1 Create a national AMR containment policy for control use of antimicrobials in humans and animals, and implement a comprehensive evidence-based formal antimicrobial stewardship programmes at the national level

## KEY ACTIVITIES

## Description of Activity

Strategic Objective 5:  (Economic) Case For Sustainable Investments And Increase Investments In New Medicines, Diagnostic Tools, Vaccines And Other Interventions To Reduce Antimicrobial Use

The  GAP  AMR  posits  that  the  economic  case  should  reflect  the  need  for  capacity  building  and  training  in  low  resource  settings,  while developing evidence based interventions to reduce infections and combat AMR. The 2001 strategy for AMR containment could not achieve its goals; one of the reasons cited for the same is that there was absence of economic assessments, which evaluated the cost of doing nothing versus the cost/benefits of action at the present.

The Situational Analysis in Maldives indicates that research on AMR has not been a priority for both policy makers and research community. Limited evidence exists on the nature and extent of AMR as a public health threat and drivers of AMR and AMU. This calls for policy and program relevant research to support planning and implementation of public health interventions. The phase of development of the health system provides  an  opportunity  to  put  in  place  strategic  research  agenda  for  public  health  research  and  AMR  in  particular  to  inform  health  system responses.

The  Strategic  Plan  lays  down  a  roadmap  for  establishing  a  strategic  research  agenda,  with  systematically  prioritised  research  areas  and knowledge gaps related  to  AMR that will  feed  into  a  national  policy  for  research  and  innovation.  By  2022,  multi-stakeholder  platform  and research consortia will be established that will generate program and policy relevant evidence on and compare cost effectiveness of AMR control strategies.  The  strategic  plan  also  envision    collaborations  with  national  and  international  agencies,  for  implementation  of  strategic  research agenda. This will be one of the key strategies for Maldives, given its existing nature of AMR threat and limited institutional capacity.

## Objective 5.1: To promote sustainable investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions by developing a strategic research agenda and national research policy

Strategic intervention 5.1 Generate cost effectiveness and benefit evidence for reducing AMU &amp; AMR; develop a national strategic research agenda

## Way Forward

The National Action Plan for prevention and control of AMR in Maldives covers the period 20172022.  It  factors  in  the  expert  view  of  stakeholders  from  different  ministries  to  come  up  with  a Strategic Plan, outlining a set of operational details. The Plan takes into account both strengths and limitations that are unique to Maldives and consolidates them before formulating a vision of AMR prevention and control. It builds on the government's concern to make universal healthcare available to all and to simultaneously ensure animal welfare and food security across the length and breadth of the country.

The Plan draws from valuable insights that emerged from a Situation Analysis that was conducted along with one-on-one interviews, guided discussions and participative dialogues that were undertaken  with  multiple  stakeholders  from  the  government,  civil  society,  NGOs  and  others. Technical  support  was  provided  by  WHO  Country  office,  WHO  SEARO  and  an  independent Consultant.

The  NAP  AMR  of  Maldives  in  its  existing  form  provides  a  constructive  opportunity  for  the government  to  fine  tune  it  based  on  its  local  realities  and  sensitivities.  Further,  it  presents  an affirmative statement of goals, objectives and strategic interventions that will be deployed to achieve the objectives set out clearly in the document.

The strategic  plan  or  roadmap  outlines  collaborations  with  national  and  international  agencies,  for implementation of a strategic research agenda that has potential to serve as a major strategy for the country. Undoubtedly, it will use both evidence to guide programme planning and action. Essential elements of AMR containment which have so far not completely taken off the ground will now see movement as comprehensive awareness programmes are conducted, surveillance of AMR and AMU including laboratory capacity, IPC and AMSP are strengthened and other public health functions are aligned to the new AMR goals.

Following submission of the final report to the World Health Assembly, the Government of Maldives will continue with its deliberations and planning process under the leadership of NMSC. Next, the NMSC through its constituent NACC, TSCs and Task Forces will draw up a detailed operational plan in  addition  to  its  budget,  monitoring  and  evaluation  plan  for  successful  implementation  of  the activities. Most of these activities will be implemented by the key actors as outlined in the strategic plan that covers the period 2017-22.

The successful implementation of the NAP AMR within a stipulated time frame is estimated to bring together all the critical players from the human and animal health and related domains on a common platform.  This  will  inevitably  create  greater  responsibility,  ownership  and  transparency.  Working closely with a more sensitized and aware population, Maldives, like other countries in the region, is expected to bring down its levels of AMR. In the months to come it will also institutionalize some of its mechanisms to better manage and arrest the spread of AMR.

## Annexures

## Annexure 1: Interpretation of phase of AMR prevention and control program implementation

## Phase of Programme Implementation

What it means

Phase 1

Phase of Exploration and Adoption

## Phase 2 Phase of Programme Installation

Phase 3

Phase of Initial

There are no programmes implemented in a systematic manner in order to conduct AMR prevention and control in the country. However, the process of designing a program has been initiated, and depending on the progress made (as seen through the indicators), it may  be that one or more of the following activities are being undertaken:

- -Identification of needs, options and resources
- -Identification of potential barriers to implementation  (funding, human resources, system responsiveness, etc.)
- -Investing  in  systems  to  augment  their  readiness  to  deploy  the programme and overcome the identified barriers in implementation
- -Identifying  structures  (both  in  policy  making  and  implementation frameworks) to aid in the implementation of the programme

As  the  nation  gets  closer  to  the  end  of  Phase  1,  it  is  on  the  verge  of implementing  (at  any  scale,  even  a  pilot  project)  an  AMR  surveillance programme.

The decision to implement a programme has been made and the initial set of  activities  have  been  undertaken  in  order  to  launch  the  program.  These may include:

- -Capacity building
- -Resource allocation
- -Establishment of data transmission, security, and sharing protocols
- -Development  of  process  indicators,  standard  operation  protocols and other guidelines to be adhered to by institutions participating in the programme

In course of the second phase, there is more emphasis on development of infrastructure, and allocation of resources in order to implement a programme in a defined context and then scale it up to the national context in the subsequent phases.

This  is probably  the  most  challenging  phase  in  the  stages  of early implementation  of  any  programme  within  the  context  of  developing

Implementation

## Phase 4 Phase of Full

Operation

Phase 5

Phase of Sustainable Operation nations. In this phase, there is a need to initiate a change or an intervention, which may have patchy uptake or maybe avoided altogether.

- -In  course  of  this  phase,  a  functional  model  of  the  program  is identified
- -All protocols, SOPs, etc. undergo a real world challenge

This is a very crucial phase and most programs are likely to find it difficult to come out of this phase.

This is the process of scaling up a successful model of the programme that may have been trialled in the previous phase.

- -The programme is part of accepted practice
- -There is a nation-wide (or a large scale) adoption of the programme
- -The programme is functional by  generating outputs  and  outcomes on a regular basis (seek proof of evidence)

This  is  the  highest  grade  of  operational  efficiency  of  the  programme  and indicates that the programme can have long-term survival.

- -The programme is resilient to changes in funding volume, partner agency  support,  etc.  external  factors  which  were  essential  for installation and initial implementation of the programme.
- -Through a functional M&amp;E  mechanism, there is systematic improvement of capacity, especially in human resources and system capacity,  to  enable  the  programme  to  function  without  extensive need to invest in continued capacity building
