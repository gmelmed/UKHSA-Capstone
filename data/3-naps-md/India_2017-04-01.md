## Executive summary

The threat posed by antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to public health as well as global health security has been reiterated in numerous World Health Assembly (WHA) resolutions. AMR is also  prioritized  under  the  Global  Health  Security  Agenda  (GHSA),  and  India  is  one  of  the contributing countries. The Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare (MoHFW) identified AMR as one of the top 10 priorities for the ministry's collaborative work with WHO. The National Health Policy 2017 identifies antimicrobial resistance as a problem and calls for effective action to address it. An international conference on AMR - 'Combating Antimicrobial Resistance: A Public Health Challenge and Priority', was jointly organized by the Government of India and World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2016, which was attended by more than 350 participants. The Hon'ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, and the Hon'ble Union Minister for Health, Shri J.P. Nadda have reiterated government's commitment to tackle AMR.

In  May  2015,  the  sixty-eighth  World  Health  Assembly  endorsed  the  Global  Action  Plan  on Antimicrobial Resistance (GAP-AMR) - including antibiotic resistance, the most urgent drug resistance trend. The WHA resolution urges Member States to align their National Action Plan on AMR with GAP-AMR by May 2017.  Commitment by global leaders to combat AMR was further  strengthened  at  the  High  Level  Meeting  on  AMR  at  the  United  Nations  General Assembly on 21 September 2016.

The Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare notified three governance mechanisms in September 2016  to  address  this  challenge.  These  include  the  Intersectoral  Coordination  Committee, Technical Advisory Group and Core Working Group on AMR for technical coordination and oversight.  The  Core  Working  Group has  been  activated  and  has  drafted  the  National  Action Plan  on  Antimicrobial  Resistance  (NAP-AMR),  which  was  further  reviewed  at  the  National Workshop on Development of National Action Plan on AMR that included members from Core Working Group and the Technical Advisory Group.

The strategic objectives of NAP-AMR are aligned with the global action plan based on national needs and priorities, and in addition to the 5 priorities of GAP-AMR, India has a sixth priority that is India-specific dealing with India's leadership on AMR - including international, national and sub-national collaborations on AMR. Six strategic priorities have been identified under the NAP-AMR (i) improving awareness and understanding of AMR through effective

communication,  education  and  training; (ii) strengthening  knowledge  and  evidence  through surveillance; (iii) reducing the incidence of infection through effective infection prevention and control; (iv) optimizing the use of antimicrobial agents in health, animals and food; (v) promoting investments  for  AMR  activities,  research  and  innovations;  and (vi) strengthening  India's leadership on AMR.

Strategic  priority  1  focuses  on  improving  awareness  and  understanding  of  AMR  through effective communication, education and training, and has 2 focus areas - first is communications and  information,  education,  communication  (IEC)  resources  to  raise  awareness  amongst  all stakeholders, and second focus area is education and training to improve the knowledge and behaviour of professionals in all sectors. Strategic priority 2 aims to strengthen knowledge and evidence through surveillance of AMR, with 2 focus areas - strengthening laboratories in human, animal,  food  and  environment  sectors,  as  well  as  ensuring  surveillance  of  antimicrobial resistance in human, animal, food and environment sectors.

Strategic  priority  3  attempts  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  infection  through  effective  infection prevention and control in healthcare to reduce the burden of infection, in animal health and food to reduce spread of AMR and antimicrobials through animals and food, and in community and environment  to  reduce  the  spread  of  AMR  and  antimicrobials  in  the  environment.  Strategic priority  4  shall  optimize  the  use  of  antimicrobial  agents  in  health,  animals  and  food  through strengthening regulations, ensuring access and surveillance of antimicrobial use, antimicrobial stewardship in healthcare as well as animal health and agriculture.

Strategic priority 5 aims to promote investments for AMR activities, research and innovations through  new  medicines  and  diagnostics,  innovations  to  develop  alternative  approaches  to manage  infectious diseases, and  sustainable  financing to ensure  adequate  resources for containment of AMR. Strategic priority 6 focuses on strengthening India's leadership on AMR through  international  collaborations  to  ensure  India's  contributions  towards  global  efforts  to contain AMR, national collaborations to facilitate collaborations among vertical disease control programmes and national stakeholders,  and  state  level  collaborations  to  ensure  action  at  the ground level against AMR.

Within each strategic priority and focus area, strategic interventions, key activities and outputs have been defined with tentative responsibility and timelines - short (within 1 year), medium (between 1 and 3 years) and long-term (between 3 and 5 years).

## 1. Background

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been identified as a global health threat with serious health, political  and  economic  implications.  It  has  also  been  prioritized  in  numerous  World  Health Assembly (WHA) and Regional Committee resolutions. The health ministers from the SouthEast Asia Region, including the Hon'ble Union Health Minister from India, are signatories to the Jaipur Declaration on Antimicrobial Resistance, 2011.

AMR is also prioritized under the global health security agenda action package, and India is one of the contributing countries. The  global commitment  to  combat  AMR  was  further strengthened by the High Level Meeting on AMR at the United Nations General Assembly on 21 September 2016, in which global leaders reiterated their commitment to act on AMR through a political declaration that was adopted as a UN General Assembly resolution.

The national policy for containment of antimicrobial resistance for India was published in 2011. In November 2014, the WHO Regional Committee meeting advocated with Member States for acceleration of national efforts to build capacities to implement the Jaipur Declaration on AMR and the South-East Asia Regional Strategy on AMR.

The Indian Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi recently reaffirmed the joint Indo-US commitment  to the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) and the timely implementation of its objectives.    The  Prime  Minister  noted

Prime  Minister  Shri  Narendra  Modi noted  India's role on  the Steering Group of Global Health Security Agenda,  and  its leadership  in  the area of antimicrobial resistance

India's  role  on  the  Steering  Group  of  GHSA  and  its  leadership  in  the  area  of  antimicrobial resistance.  The  Prime  Minister  also  drew  attention  of  the  countrymen  to  the  menace  of antibiotic resistance in his Mann ki Baat on  31  July  2016,  and  called  upon  everyone  to  practice responsible use of antibiotics.

The National Health Policy 2017 highlights the problem of antimicrobial resistance and calls for a rapid standardization of guidelines regarding antibiotic use, limiting the use of antibiotics as over-the-counter medications, banning or restricting the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in animal livestock, and pharmacovigilance including prescription audits inclusive of antibiotic usage - in the hospital and community.

In addition, the Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare (MoHFW) has also identified AMR as one of the top 10 priorities for the Ministry's collaborative work with WHO for 2018-2019.

## 1.1 Introduction

In  May 2014, the World Health Assembly requested the development of a global action plan (GAP) on antimicrobial resistance, in resolution WHA67.25, reflecting a global consensus that antimicrobial resistance poses a profound threat to human health.

The WHO Secretariat led the development of the Global Action Plan on AMR (GAP-AMR) that takes into account the commitment, perspectives and roles of all relevant stakeholders, and in which everyone has clear and  shared  ownership  and  responsibilities.  In  May  2015,  the  sixtyeight  World  Health  Assembly  endorsed  the  GAP-AMR  to  tackle  antimicrobial  resistance  including antibiotic resistance, the most urgent drug resistance trend. The WHA resolution also requests Member States to align their national action plans with GAP-AMR by May 2017.

The Global Action Plan on AMR provides a broad framework for combating AMR. The goal of GAP-AMR  is  to  ensure,  for  as  long  as  possible,  continuity  of  successful  treatment  and prevention of infectious diseases with effective and safe medicines that are quality-assured, used in a responsible way, and accessible to all who need them. The FAO Action Plan on AMR has 4 strategic objectives that are aligned with the GAP-AMR.

To achieve its goal, the global action plan sets out five strategic objectives, to:

- 1. Improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance;
- 2. Strengthen knowledge through surveillance and research;
- 3. Reduce the incidence of infection;
- 4. Optimize the use of antimicrobial agents in health, animal and food sectors; and
- 5. Develop the economic case for sustainable investment that takes account of the needs of all countries, and increase investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions.

An international conference on AMR - 'Combating Antimicrobial Resistance: A Public Health Challenge and Priority', was jointly organized by the Government of India and World Health Organization  (WHO)  in  February  2016,  which  was  attended  by  more  than  350  participants including policy makers from Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Ministry of Agriculture

and  Farmers  Welfare,  Department  of  Animal  Husbandry  Dairying  and  Fisheries,  Ministry  of Environment, and also clinicians and microbiologists, as well as international experts and policy makers from neighbouring countries.

Shri  J.P.  Nadda,  the  Hon'ble  Union  Health  Minister  reinforced  India's  strong  commitment, leadership and resolve to combat AMR and necessity of all stakeholders involved to contribute to pave the way for effective action to combat AMR.  The strategic objectives of the NAP-AMR are aligned to the GAP-AMR based on national needs and priorities.

This document details the national priorities to tackle AMR in India, and provides a roadmap to guide  the  country  in  tackling  this  public  health  challenge.  The  next  section  provides  an overview of the AMR situation in India. Subsequent sections cover the goal and objectives of the national  action  plan,  governance  mechanisms  and  strategic  priorities  along  with  strategic interventions, key activities, and outputs with timelines.

## 1.2 AMR and its containment in India

## 1.2.1. AMR in man and animals

India is among the nations with the highest burden of bacterial infections. An estimated 410,000 children  aged  five  years  or  less  die  from  pneumonia  in  India  annually;  with  pneumonia accounting for almost 25% of all child deaths. The crude mortality from infectious diseases in India today is 417 per 100,000 persons. Consequently, the impact of AMR is likely to be higher in the Indian setting.

AMR is a major public health concern in India. The emergence of resistance is not only limited to the older and more frequently used classes of drugs but there has also been a rapid increase in resistance to the newer and more expensive drugs, like carbapenems. Available data indicates to rising rates of AMR, across multiple pathogens of clinical importance, at the national scale. In 2008, about 29% of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus were methicillin resistant, and by 2014, this had  risen  to 47%.  In  contrast,  in countries  which  have  established  effective  antibiotic stewardship  and/or  infection  prevention  and  control  programs,  the  proportion  of  methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates have been decreasing. Extended-spectrum betalactamase  (ESBL)  producing  strains  of  Enterobacteriaceae  have  emerged  as  a  challenge  in hospitalized patients as well as in the community. In a multicentric study conducted in seven

tertiary care hospitals in Indian cities, 61% E. coli were ESBL producers. In the same study, 3151% Klebsiella species  were  carbapenem  resistant  and  65% Pseudomonas sp.  were  resistant  to ceftazidime, and 42% were resistant to imipenem.

The  Indian  Network  for  Surveillance  of  Antimicrobial  Resistance  (INSAR)  reported  MRSA prevalence rate of 41% based on data from 15 tertiary care centres, and also showed a high rate of resistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, and clindamycin. Another study showed incidence of community acquired MRSA about 10% and reduced susceptibility to vancomycin in about 12% of the isolates of Enterococcus fecalis .  Among blood cultures isolates of Salmonella Typhi at a tertiary  care  hospital  in  Delhi,  resistance  was  observed  to  nalidixic  acid (96.7%),  ciprofloxacin  (37.9%)  and  azithromycin  (7.3%)  and  multi-drug  resistance  in  3.4% isolates.

Recent studies in India show that most isolates of V. cholerae O1 are resistant to the commonlyused antibiotics, such as ampicillin, furazolidone, ciprofloxacin, and tetracycline. Resistance of V.  cholerae to  ceftriaxone  has  been  reported  from  Delhi.  A  report  of Neisseria  gonorrhoeae from patients  at  a  sexually  transmitted  diseases  clinic  in  Delhi  highlighted  alarming  increase  in multidrug resistant isolates (23.3%) over 14 years (1996-2008).

The burden of AMR in livestock and food animals has been poorly documented in India. Aside from sporadic, small, localized studies, evidence that can be extrapolated to the national level is lacking. Given that there are few regulations against the use of antibiotics for non-therapeutic purposes in India, the emergence of AMR from antibiotic overuse in the animal sector is likely to be an unmeasured burden in India.

Drug resistant bacteria have been isolated from dairy cattle as early as the 1970s. One of the most common clinical issues encountered in the dairy farms is mastitis, which maybe sub-clinical or overtly symptomatic. Commonly thought to be a disease of production, milk from mastitic cows and buffaloes have been shown to contain a wide range of bacteria, with a wide spectrum of resistance  against  commonly  used  antibiotics.  In  some  cases,  multiple  drug  resistant  bacteria have been seen to co-infect animals suffering from mastitis.

As with the dairy sector, there is limited evidence available on the exact amount of antibiotic consumed  within  the  poultry  industry,  and  what  are  the  various  indications  for  which  the medications were prescribed. In many cases, since the antibiotic is given as a growth promoter through the premixed feed, which comes with added antibiotics that are not even mentioned on

the label, it is difficult to exactly estimate the dose or the consumption levels of antibiotics in the  poultry  sector.  Individual  studies  have  consistently  shown  that  bacteria  isolated  from animals or seafood have high levels of resistance.

The  legislative  conditions  regulating  the  aquaculture  processes  is  different  from  those  in  the poultry or the dairy industry. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) banned the use of antibiotics and several pharmacologically active substances in fisheries. In contrast, there  is  no  regulation  in  the  poultry  industry  where  many  of  the  commercially  available  premixed  feeds  come  with  added  antibiotics.  These  drugs  can,  of  course,  be  added  to  the  feeds separately by the farmers.  Compared to the poultry and dairy sector, antibiotic resistance has been scrutinized more closely in the aquaculture sector. The existence of legislative provisions to contain the inappropriate and non-therapeutic use of antibiotics in fisheries is expected to impact the levels of AMR in the aquaculture sector. However, in a recent study that examined over 250 samples, it was seen that multi-drug resistant bacteria were isolated from over twothirds of the samples.

There exists a large body of evidence, which comprises of studies investigating the resistance profiles of bacteria isolated from both sick and healthy cattle. However, these studies cannot be compiled to obtain a representative picture of the problem at the national scale. Driven by local contexts, these studies can provide a rough overview of the magnitude of the problem of drug resistance in bacteria, but for obtaining a more comprehensive and holistic understanding, it is imperative to have a broad based surveillance system in place.

## 1.2.2. Awareness and understanding of AMR

The  GAP-AMR  states  that  the  first  strategic  objective  in  effectively  containing  AMR  is  to improve awareness and understanding of AMR through effective communication, education and training. The strategy envisions that the awareness building has to proceed on several fronts at the  same  time.  On  one  hand  it  has  to  leverage  public  communication  programs  to  encourage behaviour change in target populations - namely stakeholders in human health, animal health and agriculture; and on the other there needs to be concerted efforts to incorporate AMR as a core component in the professional education of medical and veterinary professionals.

The need to focus on awareness building, both in consumers and providers, was highlighted by the results of the multi-country public awareness survey that was conducted by WHO in 2015.

The findings of the study highlight important deficits in the understanding of what antibiotics are, how they should be used and when to take them. There is ample evidence to suggest that there  is  some  pressure  from  patients  which  forces  medical  practitioners  to  overprescribe antibiotics,  especially  for conditions like  viral illnesses,  upper  respiratory tract  infections and diarrhoea, for which antibiotic therapies are not the recommended first line of approach.

Given  the  financial  incentives  to  prescribe  antibiotics  and  the  role  of  the  pharmaceutical industry  in  encouraging  prescription  of  antibiotics  in  India,  there  is  a  need  to  approach  the process  of  awareness  generation  with  additional  legislative  support.  Internationally  there  is evidence that awareness generation campaigns in combination with other interventions that are organized at the national level may be successful to reduce antibiotic use.

There is  also  a  need  to  increase  the  awareness  about  the  need  to  contain  AMR  at  the  higher levels of policy-making, so that it may emerge as a priority in the health policies of the nation. In 2011,  the  health  ministers  of  the  South-East  Asia  Region's  Member  States  articulated  their commitment to combat AMR through the Jaipur Declaration on AMR. This was a high-level commitment  to  prioritize  AMR  control  programmes  at  the  highest  levels  of  national  policy making.

## 1.2.3. Surveillance of AMR

India  has  previously  instituted  surveillance  of  the  emergence  of  drug  resistance  in  disease causing microbes in the context of vertical programmes, like the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme  (RNTCP),  the  National  Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), and the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP), to name a few. However, a cross-cutting  programme  dealing  with  antimicrobial  resistance  across  multiple  microbes  has been lacking.

The  'National  Programme  on  the  Containment  of  Antimicrobial  Resistance'  was  launched under the aegis of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) under the 12 th Five  Year Plan (2012 - 2017). The objectives of this programme were to establish a laboratory based AMR surveillance system of 30 network laboratories, generating quality data on AMR for pathogens of  public  health  importance;  to  strengthen  infection  control  guidelines  and  practices,  and promote rational use of antibiotics; and to generate awareness about the use of antibiotics in both healthcare providers and in the community. The policy focus included: situation analysis

regarding  the  manufacture,  use  and  misuse  of  antimicrobials;  creating  a  national  surveillance system;  identifying  prescription  patterns  and  establishing  a  monitoring  system  for  the  same; enforce  enhanced  regulatory  provisions  with  respect  to  marketing  of  antimicrobials;  develop specific intervention measures such as antibiotic policies for healthcare facilities; development of diagnostic aids related to monitoring AMR.

At present, ten network laboratories have been identified in the first phase of the programme, in course of which four pathogens of public health importance are being tracked: Klebsiella spp , E. coli, Staphylococcus  aureus, and Enterococcus spp.  The  network  intends  to  extend  testing  of resistance  to  two  more  index  bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp.  Reporting from  the  ten  laboratories  puts  overall  resistance  rates  to  be  very  high,  against  the  commonly used fluoroquinolones, third generation cephalosporins and carbapenems, although resistance against  reserve  drugs  like  vancomycin  was  not  noted  in  isolates  of Staphylococcus  aureus , or against colistin in gram negative bacteria. A strategy to scale the programme up in order to carry out surveillance of hospital acquired infections and antibiotic use patterns in healthcare settings has also been outlined; additional focus on building awareness about rational use of drugs on a continuous basis is also being planned.

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) established a national network on surveillance of  antimicrobial  resistance  in  laboratories  based  at  tertiary  care  academic  centres,  targeting medically important index microbes which have been identified by WHO. The Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Research Network (AMRSN) established by the ICMR started with six reference labs located in four tertiary care medical institutions. The network is being expanded to include 15 more medical colleges/corporate hospitals.

The AMRSN also incorporates in-depth understanding of clonality of drug resistant pathogens and the transmission dynamics to enable better understanding of AMR in Indian context and devise suitable interventions. The AMRSN, although currently limited to the human health side, plans  to  scale  up  on  a  national  scale  and  expand  its  ambit  to  include  samples  from  a  wider spectrum of sources, including animal, environmental and food samples, to reflect the principles of a One Health approach based surveillance system. Currently the laboratory network has been expanded to include ten centres.

Aside  from  the  absence  of  a  One  Health  approach  to  surveillance,  another  weakness  of  the existing surveillance systems for AMR in India is that it does not account for antibiotic use. The existence  of  a  surveillance  system  that  can  establish  the  relationship  between  the  antibiotic

consumption patterns and emergence of AMR is vital to producing evidence that may help in the designing and evaluation of effective interventions.

## 1.2.4. Infection prevention and control

The background report on the role  of  infection  prevention  and  control  (IPC)  programmes  in order  to  contain  AMR,  which  was  commissioned  by  the  WHO,  has  highlighted  the  critical nature  of  this  issue.  Functional  infection  control  programs  not  only  cut  down  the  rates  of nosocomial  infections,  but  also  reduce  the  volume  of  antibiotic  consumption  and  have  been identified to be part of any comprehensive strategy to contain AMR.

The  ICMR guidelines  on  infection  control,  which  are  locally  relevant  and  implementable  for India were released last year at the international conference on AMR, which further identified the  need  to  develop  IPC  standards  for  each  level  of  healthcare  facility,  not  just  tertiary  care centres. It noted the need to establish functional hospital infection control committees (HICCs) to provide leadership to the IPC programs at the institutional level. The need to integrate IPC programs,  both  from  the  policy  making  and  implementation  angles,  was  also  stressed. Establishing IPC focal experts at the policy making levels and linking of IPC programs to AMR surveillance, and nosocomial infection surveillance were identified as key policy integrations to drive  more  successful  IPC  programs  in  India.  NCDC  has  recently  developed  guidelines  for hospital infection prevention and control and is also developing a policy on infection control, which is in the final phases of preparation.

ICMR  launched  the  programme  on  Antimicrobial  Stewardship,  Prevention  of  Infection  and Control (ASPIC) in 2012 through the collaboration between the office of the National Chair of Clinical Pharmacology, ICMR and the Christian Medical College, Vellore. A national workshop was  hosted  as  a  part  of  a  one  year  programme  to  develop  capacity  of  key  stakeholders  in Antibiotic  Stewardship.  In  addition  to  launching  the  AMRSN,  the  ICMR  also  instituted  an evaluation of the AMSP practices through an in-depth facility survey in private and government health care institutions.

The results  showed that  though there  was a  very  high  degree  of  adherence  to  the  guidelines when  it  came  to  dealing  with  healthcare  associated  infections  (HAIs)  or  hospital  infection control (HIC) measures, compliance was poor with the other aspects of antibiotic stewardship, especially with respect to having a documented stewardship programme, antibiotic prescription

guidelines and usage surveillance, and a truly multidisciplinary team. It was also seen that the stewardship  programmes in  private  institutions  were  better  equipped  to  deal  with  emerging crises like AMR or HAI outbreaks, in comparison to the government facilities in the survey. It is suggested  that  the  accreditation  mandates,  which  certain  private  institutes  adhere  to  on account of financial compulsions, may have a positive impact on the programme. The evaluation report recommends  that  government  healthcare  facilities also need to seek mandatory accreditations  to  improve  their  stewardship  programmes.  The  survey  revealed  a  paucity  of implementation strategies, including formulary restrictions and drug rotation policies. Prescription audits were conducted in very few institutions; efforts in development, dissemination  and  regularly  updated  prescription  policies  were  also  deficient;  absence  of computer assisted programmes, especially in government facilities, also hampered the work of the stewardship programme.

## 1.2.5. Use of antimicrobials

At 12.9x10  units of antibiotics consumed in 2010, India was the largest consumer of antibiotics 9 for  human health. Although the per capita consumption of antibiotics in India (10.7 units per capita) was lower than that seen in many other countries (e.g. 22 units per capita in USA).

Since March 2014 a separate Schedule H-1 has been incorporated in Drug and Cosmetic rules to regulate the sale of antimicrobials in the country.  About 24 antimicrobials belonging to third and fourth generation cephalosporins and carbapenems are covered under the schedule. These antimicrobials cannot be sold without a proper medical prescription and these drug packaging are required to be labelled with the following text along with red border. 'Schedule H1 Drug Warning: It is dangerous to take the drug except in accordance with medical advice, Not to be sold by retail without the prescription of a registered medical practitioner.' A separate register has to be maintained by the pharmacist giving details of the prescriber, the patient as well as the drug sold.

With respect to consumption of antimicrobials in food animals, the global consumption was estimated to be 63,151 (±1,560) units in 2010; India accounts for 3% of the global consumption and is the fourth highest in the world, behind China (23%), the United States (13%) and Brazil (9%).  The  consumption  of  antimicrobials  in  the  food  animals  sector  in  India  is  expected  to double by 2030.

The absence of stringently framed and implemented regulatory frameworks to limit the use of antimicrobials  in  livestock  and  food  animals,  especially  for  non-therapeutic  purposes,  like growth promotions, has been one of the drivers of antibiotic overuse at the community level. A more  recent  directive  has  been  issued  in  January  2015  by  the  FSSAI  which  outlines  certain principles that include limiting the use of antibiotics in livestock rearing; it does little besides reiterating  the  directives  of  a  previous  advisory  from  the  Department  of  Animal  Husbandry, Dairying  and  Fisheries.  The  National  AMR  Containment  Policy  highlighted  the  need  to establish a separate Schedule H1, under the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, to regulate the sales of antibiotics.  Guidelines  for  punitive  actions  against  agencies  that  are  in  contravention  of  such policies  are  also  outlined.  The  national  policy  also  outlined  the  proposal  for  colour-coding antibiotic strips, and newer  molecules (carbapenems, tigecycline, daptomycin,  etc.), to eliminate  their  use  outside  of  tertiary  care  settings.  The  Red  Line  Campaign  developed  along with Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) was launched in New Delhi in February 2016.

## 1.2.6. Research and innovations

In 2004, in the 15 largest pharmaceutical companies, only 1.6% of the drugs in the development stages were antibiotics, and none of them were from novel classes, nor were they targeted to treat multidrug resistant agents. Despite the obvious need to develop newer classes of drugs to respond to the challenges of emerging AMR, there are few late stage candidates in the process of development.  Additionally,  pharmaceutical agencies have  been  reluctant  to  invest  in  research and  development  of  antibiotics  owing  to  the  nature  of  the  market,  the  current  policies  on conservation of newer classes of antimicrobials and the nature of antibiotic chemotherapy for infectious diseases.

Development of antibiotic resistance breakers (ARBs) to restore effectiveness of older classes of antibiotics has also emerged as an innovative way around the issue of resistance. ARBs can be known compounds as well as novel molecules which have no or minimal antibacterial activity, but which help in restoring the effectiveness of drugs to which the microbes would otherwise be resistant. The current consensus seems to be that there is a need to develop ARBs that are likely  to  salvage  key  members  of  each  group  of  antibiotics,  especially  those  that  target  Gram negative bacteria.

## 1.2.7. National response

Historically,  AMR  has  not  received  adequate  focus  and  attention  in  India.  However,  recent trends  clearly  illustrate  the  growing  political  commitment  at  the  highest  levels  to  have  a coherent response in place that can provide the necessary gravitas for nation-wide surveillance and stewardship for containment of AMR. Efforts are also being made to incorporate the One Health approach into these plans.

Acknowledging  the  problem  of  antimicrobial  resistance,  the  Government  of  India  has  taken series  of  initiatives  to  tackle  the  growing  antimicrobial  resistance  including  constitution  of  a National  Task  Force  on  AMR  Containment  in  2010  leading  to  development  of  the  national policy  on  AMR  containment  in  early  2011.  The  Ministry  of  Health  and  Family  Welfare, Government  of  India  launched  the  National  Programme  on  Containment  of  Antimicrobial Resistance under the Twelfth Five Year Plan (2012-2017).

National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), New Delhi is the focal point for implementation and coordination  of  the  AMR  programme.  Ten  network laboratories  in  different  parts  of  the country are part of a surveillance network on four common bacterial pathogens of public health importance. The network laboratories and pathogens are being expanded in a phased manner and  30  laboratories  are  targeted  in  the  next  couple  of  years  to  generate  quality  data  on antimicrobial resistance for pathogens of public health importance.

To  promote  rational  use  of  antibiotics,  national  treatment  guidelines  for  antimicrobial  use  in infectious diseases has been released to serve as a reference guide for hospitals in the country for formulating  their  own  local  guidelines  on  the  basis  of  which  physicians  will  be  trained. National  infection  control  policy  has  been  drafted  and  is  in  the  process  of  finalization  for strengthening infection control practices.

The  Ministry  of  Health  and  Family  Welfare  has  recently  notified  3  governance  mechanisms towards  this  -  an  Intersectoral  Coordination  Committee,  a  Technical  Advisory  Group  and  a Core Working Group on AMR.

The  recent  political  declaration/UN  resolution  on  AMR  following  the  high  level  meeting  on AMR at the United Nations General Assembly is an opportunity for the technical leadership in India to leverage the current conducive policy environment for effective action against AMR.

## 2. Developing the National Action Plan on AMR

## 2.1 Governance mechanisms

The Government of India is strongly committed to tackling AMR in the country and lead the global and regional AMR agenda. The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi highlighted India's role  in  tackling  AMR  at  the  joint  statement  issued  after  the  meeting  with  President  Barack Obama of  the  United  States  of  America,  as  well  as  the  Government's  commitment  to  tackle AMR during his Mann ki Baat address in July 2016.

Governance  mechanisms  are  essential  for  effective  intersectoral  coordination  of  activities  to combat AMR. They are also important to engage key stakeholders in the development of NAPAMR to  ensure  their  ownership  during  the  implementation  phase.  Governance  mechanisms need political  support  and  authority to  take actions,  and are  more  likely to  be  effective  with clearly  defined  terms  of  reference.  The  following  AMR  committee/groups  (figure  1)  were notified on 27 September 2016.

Figure 1: Key governance mechanisms for AMR

The details of these committees/groups are provided in annex 1. The Technical Advisory Group and Core  Working  Group  are  specific  for  governance  mechanisms  in  the  human  health  sector. Similar groups are needed in the other sectors to coordinate their response in tackling AMR.

## 3. National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance

## 3.1 Goal

The overarching goal of the National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (NAP-AMR) is to effectively combat antimicrobial resistance in India, and contribute towards the global efforts to tackle this public health threat. It shall establish and strengthen governance mechanisms as well as the capacity of all stakeholders to reduce the impact of AMR in India. The scope of the NAPAMR focusses primarily on resistance in bacteria.

## 3.2 Objectives

The following are the specific objectives of the NAP-AMR:

- 1. Define  the  strategic  priorities,  key  actions,  outputs,  responsibilities,  and  indicative timeline  and  budget  to  slow  the  emergence  of  AMR  in  India  and  strengthen  the organizational &amp;amp; management structures to ensure intra- &amp;amp; inter-sectoral coordination with a One Health approach;
- 2. Combat  AMR  in  India  through  better understanding and awareness of AMR, strengthened  surveillance,  prevention  of  emergence  and  spread  of  resistant  bacteria through infection prevention and control, optimised use of antibiotics in all sectors, and enhanced investments for AMR activities, research and innovations; and
- 3. Enable monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) of the NAP-AMR implementation based on the M&amp;amp;E framework.

## 3.3 Strategic priorities

The NAP-AMR outlines the priorities and interventions planned to be implemented over 2017 2021 to tackle the public health challenge of AMR in India.

The first 5 strategic priorities of NAP-AMR (figure 2) are aligned with the Global Action Plan on AMR and the sixth strategic priority highlights India's role in containment of AMR at the international level with other countries and organizations, national disease control programmes and at the sub-national/state level through development of state action plans on AMR to ensure action at the ground level.

Figure 2: Priorities of NAP-AMR

<!-- image -->

A  harmonized  approach  across  various  sectors  to  address  the  use  of  and  resistance  to antimicrobial  agents  in  human  health,  animal  health,  agriculture,  food  products  and  the environment is critical to address these strategic priorities.
