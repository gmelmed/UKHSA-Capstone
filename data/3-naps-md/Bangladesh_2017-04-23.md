Acronyms and Glossaries

## Glossaries:

Antimicrobial Resistance Containment : Antimicrobial Resistance Containment addresses the challenges of antimicrobial resistance to slow the emergence and reduce the spread of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms through reducing the disease burden and the spread of infection, improving access to appropriate antimicrobials, improving rational use of antimicrobials, strengthening health systems and their surveillance capabilities, enforcing regulations and legislation and encouraging the development of appropriate new drugs and vaccine

Infection prevention and control: Infection prevention and control refers to policies and procedures used to prevent occurrence of infectious diseases, minimize and prevent the risk of spreading infections, especially in hospitals and human or animal health care facilities.

Multisectoral coordination: Multisectoral  coordination  refers  to  deliberate  collaboration  among  various  stakeholder  groups  (e.g.,  government,  civil  society,  and private sector) and sectors (e.g., health, animal, environment etc.) to jointly achieve a policy outcome. By engaging multiple sectors, partners can leverage knowledge, expertise, reach, and resources, benefiting from their combined and varied strengths as they work toward the shared goal of producing better health outcomes.

National Steering Committee : It is the highest executive body at ministerial level comprising ministers, secretaries and other high officials of Ministries of Health and Family Welfare and Fisheries &amp; Livestock. It also includes top executives of concerned UN bodies, professional bodies and different stakeholders

National Strategy :  National Strategy is a national document that provides a framework of a consensual basis for the goals, objectives, priorities, area of interventions, instruments and means of the national initiatives in the national context ensuring collaborative activities by integrating new and existing programmes and initiatives into  a  cohesive,  national  response  involving  cross  sectoral  cooperation  at  the  local,  regional  and  national  levels  to  support  a  collaborative  effort  to  change  those practices  that  have  contributed  to  the  development  of  the  problem  (resistance)  and  implement  new  initiatives  to  reduce  and  combat  the  problem  (inappropriate antibiotic usage and resistance) during the next five to ten years.

National Technical Committee : It is the highest multisectoral and multidisciplinary executive technical body at directorate level headed by Director General of Health Service and Director, Disease Control, DGHS as member secretary. Representatives from Drug Administration, Livestock and Fisheries directorate, high officials of DGHS, leaders  of  professional  bodies  of  different  disciplines  and  executives  of  UN  organizations  have  been  included  in  this  committee.  Some  eminent  personalities  from different sectors are also incorporated in this committee.

## Background

Antimicrobial  Resistance  (AMR)  is  a  growing  global  public  health  threat  that  is  imposing  serious  effects  on  public  health  management  of  the  infectious  diseases. Microorganisms are now emerging with abilities to resist the killing effects of antimicrobials (AMs), making the drugs less effective or ineffective in vivo in majority of the cases.

Irrational and inappropriate use of antimicrobials, causing AMR, is a well understood natural consequence. An association between excessive and unnecessary use of AMs and drug resistance because of selective pressure has been documented. The emergence and spread of AMR are complex phenomena due to improper knowledge of AMs usage and inadequate interactions between the prescribers and the patients, along with lack of adequate attention of the regulatory bodies and the policy makers. Patient compliance with recommended treatment is another major problem. Easy availability without prescription and unqualified antimicrobials in Bangladesh also influences the emergence of resistance. The WHO and other international bodies rightly addressed AMR as the biggest threat for the management of infectious diseases.

The World Health Assembly (WHA) Resolution of 1998 urged Member States to develop multiple measures for ARC including: (i) to encourage appropriate and cost effective use of antimicrobials, (ii) to prohibit the dispensing of antimicrobials without the prescription of a qualified health care professional, (iii) to improve practices to prevent the spread of infection and thereby the spread of resistant pathogens,  (iv) to strengthen legislation to prevent the manufacture, sale and distribution of counterfeit antimicrobials and the sale of antimicrobials on the informal market, and (v) to reduce the use of antimicrobials in food-animal production.

Member  countries  of  WHA  were  also  encouraged  to  develop  sustainable  systems  to  detect  resistant  pathogens,  to  monitor  volumes  and  patterns  of  use  of antimicrobials and the impact of control measures. Following these recommendations, the health ministers of the member states of World Health Organization for South East Asia (WHO SEA) region met in Jaipur, India in September, 2011 and agreed to acknowledge the AMR as a major global public health issue, to institute a coherent,  comprehensive  and  integrated  national  approach  to  combat  AMR and  sixteen  other  activities  by  signing  to  a  charter  of  activities  named  as  the  ' Jaipur Declaration '. The other important areas in the Jaipur Declaratio n includes development of national antibiotic policy and formulation of multisectoral national alliance against AMR for multisectoral approach for regulation of use of antimicrobial agents, promotion of behavioural change in prescribers and communities for rational use of antimicrobial agents, building capacities for efficient surveillance, strengthening diagnostic capacities for microbial diseases and infection prevention and control programs.

In continuation of the efforts related to Jaipur Declaration and to review the status of implementation of AMR country plans and to align them with the AMR Global Action Plan, 2015, the designated AMR national focal points of the WHO member countries met in New Delhi, India and made many recommendations in June, 2015. These recommendations include: (1) Establishment of a national governance mechanism, (2) Development/ strengthening national surveillance system for AMR, (3)

Establishment of a national AMR reference laboratory, (3) To include AMR in education and training curriculum, (4) Strengthening of hygiene and infection prevention and control program, (5) Strengthening regulatory mechanism to ensure access of quality antibiotics, etc.

In concordance with the global and WHO activities on ARC, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) in Bangladesh has come forward and initiative was taken to conduct program for containment of antimicrobial resistance in Bangladesh. Director, Disease Control and Line Director, Communicable Disease Control, DGHS was selected as a national focal point to coordinate the national program.  Since AMR is a multi-faceted problem, conduction of activities in well-coordinated manner through One Health approach is very important.   Involvement of multi-sectoral stakeholders was  ensured by formulating different national level committees with representation from multisectoral stake holders including interministrial National Steering Committee (NSC), headed by honourable Minister for MoHFW, National Technical Committee (NTC) headed by Director General of Health Services. Subsequently a National Strategy for Antimicrobial Resistance Containment in Bangladesh was  developed  and  approved  by  the  NSC  and  the  NTC  with  further  recommendation  of  developing  a  National  Action  Plan  (NAP).  A  multisectoral  working  group representing human health, animal health and drug administration was assigned and the NAP was developed based on the national strategy covering almost all the areas recommended by the WHO and other relevant global agencies.
