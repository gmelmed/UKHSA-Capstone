## BARBADOS NATIONAL ACTION PLAN ON COMBATTING ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE 2017-2022

MINISTRY OF HEALTH, BARBADOS 5/17/2017

## Foreword

The rise in antimicrobial resistance has been described as one of the most alarming trends that threatens the future use of antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial resistance is now a serious problem in all areas of infectious  diseases  including  viral,  bacterial,  fungal  and  parasitic  diseases.  Because  of  the  lack  of systematic surveillance, this public health problem has only recently been emphasised.

Following the approval of the Global Action Plan for Antimicrobial Resistance at the 68 th World Health Assembly  in  May  2015  and  the  subsequent  high-level  meeting  of  the  UN  General  Assembly  on Antimicrobial Resistance held in September 2016 which called for national, regional and international political  commitment  to  addressing  the  issue,  Member  States  agreed  on  the  importance  of  moving forward to develop national action plans by May 2017.

The Barbados National Action Plan on Combatting Antimicrobial Resistance 2017-2022 was therefore produced with this target in mind. This action plan is a product of multi-sectoral collaboration among national stakeholders. As with almost all health care interventions, sharing the responsibility with other sectors has proven to be essential to achieving desired outcomes. I am therefore pleased that the Ministry of Health will take the lead in this initiative. I must make mention however, of the strategically chosen oversight  committee  comprising  of  but  not  limited  to  representatives  from  Surveillance,  Health Promotion,  Infection  Prevention  and  Control,  Drug  Service,  Laboratories,  Agriculture,  Customs, Commerce, Environmental Protection and the Pan American Health Organisation.

A recent assessment of the current situation in Barbados with respect to antimicrobial resistance pointed out the need for improved management with respect to antibiotics in healthcare settings, prevention of the spread of drug-resistant micro-organisms, elimination of the use of medically-important antibiotics for promoting growth in livestock, and expanded surveillance for drug-resistant bacteria in humans and animals.

I am sure that as a result of this action plan, appropriate health promotion on antimicrobial medicines would be put in place. This will be combined with strategic surveillance and research, resulting in the desired  outcome  of  optimal  use  of  antimicrobial  medicines  and  a  reduction  in  the  incidence  of antimicrobial resistance in humans and animals in Barbados. The realisation of these desired outcomes will require sustained and coordinated efforts of the oversight committee headed by the Ministry of Health.

I therefore want to express my gratitude to all of those who contributed to the development of this plan. It proposes actions which will help to further strengthen health care delivery in Barbados.  I pledge my full support to this plan and eagerly look forward to its implementation.

## INTRODUCTION

## Background

For several decades, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been a growing threat to effective treatment of an ever-increasing range of infections caused by bacteria, parasites, viruses and fungi.  AMR results in reduced efficacy of antibacterial, anti-parasitic, antiviral and antifungal drugs, making the treatment of patients difficult, costly, or even impossible.  The impact on particularly vulnerable patients is most obvious, resulting in prolonged illness and increased mortality.  The magnitude of the problem worldwide and the impact of AMR on human health, on costs for the health-care sector and the wider society are still largely unknown. (WHO, 2014) In  response  to  this  developing  public  health  issue,  a  global  action  plan  on  antimicrobial resistance has been developed and at the 68 th World Health Assembly in May 2015, Member States  approved  the  resolution  to  implement  the  Global  Action  Plan  (GAP). (WHO, WHA decision  point:  WHA  A/68/20,  A68/VR/9,  May  2015) The  GAP  embraces  the  'One  Health' concept for integrated management of AMR in the food chain.

Notably,  Member  States  agreed  on  the  importance  of  moving  forward  to  develop  national action  plans  by  May  2017.  These  plans  would  be  aligned  with  the  GAPfor  the  use  of antimicrobial medicines in animal health, agriculture and human health. (WHO, Global Action Plan for Antimicrobial Resistance (GAP-AMR), 2015)

This National Action Plan on Combatting AMR was influenced by a national multi-sectoral stakeholder consultation which included representatives from government, the private sector, University of West Indies and non-governmental organizations.  It conforms to the principles of the National Strategic Plan 2006-2025 especially in goal 4 which speaks to preserving a healthy environment and the Barbados Growth and Development Strategy 2013 - 2020 which addresses the sustainable production of safe food through agriculture and fisheries production and the protection and maintenance of human health throughout the life course.

## Alignment with AMR global action plan

The goal of the Global Action Plan for Antimicrobial Resistance (GAP-AMR) is: 'To ensure, for as long as possible, continuity of successful treatment and prevention of infectious diseases with  effective  and  safe  medicines  that  are  quality-assured,  used  in  a  responsible  way,  and accessible to all who need them'.

The five (5) Strategic Objectives of the GAP-AMR are:

In particular, all action plans should reflect the following principles identified in the GAP:

- 1. Whole-of society engagement including 'One Health' approach
- 2. Prevention first
- 3. Access
- 4. Sustainability
- 5. Incremental Targets for implementation

## Multi-sectoral systems approach

Ensuring ownership of activities across the sectors of health, agriculture, food security, animal health and economic development, is essential to achieve the desired outcome of containing antimicrobial resistance.   The 'One Health' approach acknowledges that the health of humans is directly linked to the health of animals and the environment.

## STRATEGIC VISION

## Vision

Integrated health care systems in Barbados that by 2027, work to prevent, detect, and control illness  and  death  related  to  infections  caused  by  antimicrobial  resistance  through  shared responsibility whilst ensuring sustainable medical care.

## Scope of the National Action Plan

Antimicrobial resistance encompasses resistance to drugs utilized in the treatment of infections caused by different types of pathogenic organisms.  This National Action Plan, will mainly focus on resistant bacteria that present an urgent or serious threat to public health.  This plan will serve as a guide for partners in human, veterinary and environmental health to address this problem.

## Governance

Development and implementation of the National  Action  Plan will  be  guided  by  an  intersectoral  coordinating  mechanism  named  the  National  Antimicrobial  Oversight  Committee, with Terms of Reference as at Appendix 3.  The Ministry of Health will take the lead in this initiative and the oversight Committee will comprise but not be limited to representatives from the following areas and departments:  National Epidemiology/Surveillance, Health Promotion, Infection Prevention and Control, Barbados Drug Service, Laboratories, Agriculture, Customs, Commerce, Environmental Protection Department and PAHO.

## Current Country Situation

Antibiotics  are  used  in  the  health  sector,  (community  and  hospitals)  the  agricultural  sector (livestock and cultivation) and are found in environmental media including ground, surface, marine and waste water.

Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia (CRKP), recently classified by WHO as a priority 1 resistant organism, was detected in a cluster of cases in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH) in 2013.  Resultant active surveillance of cultures to assess the burden of CRKP at the QEH, revealed that 18% of patients sampled were either infected or colonised by CRKP.  Specific antibiotics, flouroquinolones and piperacillin-tazobactam, were significantly associated with infection/colonization.  In 2014, the 12 month period prevalence of CRKP in Barbados was 50 per 100, 000 population and incidence of blood stream infection was 4 per 100,000 population (QEH, 2013).

In  the  two  year  period  2015-  2017  at  the  Veterinary  Services  Laboratory,  clinical  and surveillance isolates from varying organ systems in varied domestic animals  - dogs, horse, parrot  and  a  primate,  revealed  a  small  number  (11  cases)  of  multi-drug resistance . Gram positive and gram negative bacteria were identified in which resistance was detected over a

wide class of antimicrobial agents inclusive of aminoglycosides, cephalosporins , macrolides, penicillins,  phenicols,  polypeptides,  quinolones,  sulphonamidesand  tetracyclines  (Personal communication, VSL).

The National Antibiotic Resistance Study conducted in 2013 assessed fifty-eight (58) sample sites which included twenty-two (22) public supply wells, eighteen (18) bathing water beaches, one (1) water treatment plant, two (2) sewage treatment plants, three (3) agricultural wells, three  (3)  surface  water  sites  and  nine  (9)  polyclinics  to  determine  if  faecal  coliforms  had developed resistance to selected antibiotics.   The study indicated that there was no significant resistance  noted  in  these  groups  in  Ecoli  and  enterococcus.    In  addition  no  Carbapenem resistance in Klebseilla was found or 3rd generation resistance suggesting ESBLs. (EPD 2015).

In the human health sector, a portion of antibiotic and other antimicrobial drug use is guided by  the  Barbados  Drug  Service  (BDS)  through  the  annual  publishing  of  the  National  Drug Formulary.  However, there are other antimicrobials available which are not on formulary.

Current ability  to  test  and  register  antimicrobials  for  use  in  human  and  animals  is  limited. Incomplete, inappropriate and uncontrolled use of antimicrobials is thought to be the major driver of antimicrobial resistance in Barbados.

Surveillance systems for AMR are present but inconsistent, with few or no reporting systems. There is also rudimentary laboratory capacity for AMR testing and monitoring in Barbados and the Caribbean.

Knowledge of AMR amongst health care workers is limited to areas surrounding infection control in health care settings. There is also an element of over-prescribing and dispensing of antimicrobial medicines and the issue of incomplete treatment courses of antimicrobials.

The current legislation for antimicrobials comprise the Therapeutic Substances Act, Cap 330 and the Therapeutic Substances Regulations, 1950.The Act seeks to regulate the manufacture, importation, storage, sale and supply of penicillin and other antibiotics, and of sulphonamide drugs and other therapeutic substances through a licence granted by the Licensing Authority, the Chief Medical Officer.  However, the Regulations exempt any preparation which is to be used solely for veterinary purposes.

## Summary of Assessment

Barbados  currently  has  a  rudimentary  framework  and  capacity  to  address  the  issue  of antimicrobial resistance.  There however needs to be coordination of efforts and improvement in  areas  where  gaps  have  been  identified.Actions  required  include  improved  antibiotic stewardship in healthcare settings, prevention of the spread of drug-resistant organisms//bacteria,  elimination  of  the  use  of  medically-important  antibiotics  for  growth promotion in food animals, and expanded surveillance for drug-resistant bacteria in humans and animals.

The National Action Plan will provide the roadmap to guide Barbados in the effort to address the urgent and serious threat of AMR and will be organized around three goals for collaborative action.

## Goals of the National Action Plan

The three (3) Goals of the NAP are:

Goal 1:

Slow/Reduce the emergence of resistant bacteria and prevent the spread of resistant infections.

Goal 2:

Strengthen national 'One-Health' surveillance efforts to combat resistance

Goal 3:

Improve international collaboration and capacities for antimicrobial resistance prevention, surveillance, control and antibiotic research and development.

Goal  1:  Slow/Reduce  the  emergence  of  resistant  bacteria  and  prevent  the  spread  of resistant  infections. Judicious  use  of  antibiotics  in  healthcare  and  agricultural  settings  is essential  to  slow  the  emergence  of  resistance  and  extend  the  useful  lifetime  of  effective antibiotics. Antibiotics are a precious resource, and preserving their usefulness will require cooperation  and  engagement  by  healthcare  providers,  healthcare  leaders,  pharmaceutical companies, veterinarians, the agricultural industry, and patients. Goal 1 activities include the optimal  use  of  vaccines  to  prevent  infections,  implementation  of  healthcare  policies  and antibiotic stewardship programs that improve patient outcomes, and efforts to minimize the development of resistance by ensuring that each patient receives the right antibiotic at the right time  at  the  right  dose  for  the  right  duration. Prevention  of  resistance  also  requires  rapid detection  and  control  of  outbreaks  and  regional  efforts  to  control  transmission  across community and healthcare settings and international borders.

Goal  2:  Strengthen  national  'One-Health'  surveillance  efforts  to  combat  resistance. Improved  detection  and  control  of  drug-resistant  organisms  will  be  achieved  through  an integrated, 'One-Health' approach that includes the enhancement and integration of data from surveillance systems that monitor human pathogens with data that monitor animal pathogens. Goal  2 activities will enhance  monitoring  of  antibiotic sales, usage, resistance, and management  practices  at  multiple  points  along  the  food-production  chain,  from  farms  to processing plants to supermarkets.

Goal 3: Improve international collaboration and capacities for antimicrobial resistance prevention,  surveillance,  control  and  antibiotic  research  and  development. Antibiotic resistance is a worldwide problem that cannot be addressed by one nation in isolation. Goal 3 activities include working with foreign ministries of health and agriculture, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and other multinational organizations to enhance global capacity to detect, analyze, report antibiotic use and resistance, create incentives for the development of therapeutics and diagnostics, and strengthen global efforts to prevent and control the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistance.

## Objectives of the National Action Plan

In alignment with those of the GAP-AMR, the five (5) Objectives of the NAP are:

Objective 1:

Improve  awareness  and  understanding  of  antimicrobial  resistance through effective communication, education and training.

Objective 2:

Strengthen the knowledge and evidence base through surveillance and research including in animals, plants, the environment and food.

Objective 3:
