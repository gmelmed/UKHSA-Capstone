National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance/ Afghanistan

## Message

AMR has emerged as major public health problem worldwide leading to significant morbidity and mortality. The growing problem of AMR has resulted in significant crisis in almost all the countries of the world including Afghanistan, resulting an immense increase in the infections due to the multiresistant organisms and severely limiting the choice of antimicrobial agents available for treatment. The emergence and spread of resistance among the micro-organism is a complex phenomenon and hence requires multi-pronged approach to contain this phenomenon.

WHO through resolution WHA/67.25 in 2014 stressed the need for development of Global action plan which reflects the global consensus on the profound threat of AMR to human and animal health. Accordingly; the 68th WHA through a resolution A68/20 adopted the Global Action Plan on AMR in 2015.the global action plan aims to ensure, for as long as possible, continuity of successful treatments and prevention of infection diseases with effective and safe medicines that are quality assured, used in responsible way, and accessible to all who needed them. May May

The National Action Plan Regarding AMR addresses six priority objectives from which five Strategic objectives are that of Global Action Plan (Improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance, Strengthen knowledge through surveillance and research reduce the incidents of infections; optimize the usage of antimicrobial agents , ensure sustainable investments in countering AMR) and One Strategic objective is Customized for Afghanistan Conditions which is Strengthen Afghanistan commitment and collaborations on AMR at international, national and sub-national levels. The Government of Afghanistan shall remain committed to the WHO resolution on AMR as a Responsible member state t8 comply with global health security challenges

## Executive Summary

The threat posed by antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to public health as well as global health security has been reiterated in numerous World Health Assembly (WHA) resolutions. AMR is also prioritized under  the  Global  Health  Security  Agenda  (GHSA),  and  Afghanistan  is  one  of  the  contributing countries. The Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) identified AMR as one of the top Priorities for the ministry's collaborative work with WHO.

In May 2015, sixty-eight World Health Assembly endorsed the Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (GAP-AMR) - including antibiotics resistance, the most urgent drug resistance trends. The WAH resolution urges member state to align their National Action Plan on AMR with GAP-AMR by May 2017. Commitment by Global leaders to combat AMR was further strengthen at the High Level Meeting on AMR at the United Nation General Assembly on 21 September 2016

The  Ministry  of  Public  Health  notified  three  governance  mechanisms  in  28  November  2016  to address the challenge. These include the Intersectoral Coordination Committee, Technical Advisory Group, and Core Working group on AMR for technical coordination and oversight. The Core Working Group has been drafted the National Action Plan  during orientation workshop on Antimicrobial Resistance by Nation focal point-AMR (NF-AMR), drafted National Action Plan was further reviewed at the national workshop on Development of National Action Plan on AMR that included members from Core Working group and the Technical Advisory Group.

The starting objectives of NAP-AMR are aligned with the global action plan based on national needs and priorities, and in additional to the 5 priorities of GAP-AMR, Afghanistan has a sixth priority that is  Afghanistan's  specific dealing  with  Afghanistan's  leadership on AMR - including international, national and sub-national collaboration on AMR. Six strategic Priorities have been identified under the NAP-AMR (i) improving awareness and understanding of AMR through effective communication, education and training (ii) strengthening knowledge and evidence through surveillance (iii) reducing the incidence of infection through effective infection prevention and control; (iv) optimizing the use of antimicrobial agents in health, animals and food; (v) promoting investments for AMR activities, research and innovations; and (vi) strengthening Afghanistan's leadership on AMR.

Strategic priorities focuses on improving awareness and understanding of AMR through effective communication,  education  and  training,  and  has  2  focus  areas  -  first  is  communication  and information, education, communication (IEC) resources to raise awareness amongst all stakeholders,  and  second  focus  area  is  education  and  training  to  improve  the  knowledge  and behavioral of professionals in all sectors. Strategic priorities 2 aims to strengthen knowledge and evidence  through  surveillance  of  AMR,  with  2  focus  area  strengthening  laboratories  in  human, animal, food and environment sectors, as well as ensuring surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in human, animal, food and environment sectors.

Strategic  priority  3  attempts  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  infection  through  effective  infection prevention and control in healthcare to reduce the burden of infection, in animal health and food to  reduce  spread  of  AMR  and  antimicrobial  through  animals  and  food,  and  in  community  and environment to reduce the spread of AMR and antimicrobials in the environment. Strategic priority 4 shall optimize the use of antimicrobial agents in health, animals and food through strengthening

regulation,  ensuring  access  and  surveillance  of  antimicrobial  use,  antimicrobial  stewardship  in healthcare as well as animal health and agriculture.

Strategic  priority  5  aims  to  promote  investment  for  AMR  activities,  research  and  innovations through  new  medicine  and  diagnosis,  innovation  to  develop  alternative  approaches  to  manage infectious diseases, sustainable financing to ensure adequate resources for containment of AMR. Strategic  priority  6  focuses  on  strengthening  of  Afghanistan's  leadership  on  AMR  through international collaborations to ensure Afghanistan contribution toward global efforts to contain AM, national  collaboration  to  facilitate  collaboration  among  vertical  disease  control  programs  and national stakeholders, and state level collaborations to ensure action at the ground level against AMR.

Within each strategic priority and focus area, strategic interventions, key activities and outputs have been defined with tentative responsibility and timelines - short (within 1 year), medium (between 1 and 3 years)and long-term (between 3and 5 years).

## Background

AMR is one of the Key priority of the global health security agenda action package, as well as it is one of the commitments of Ministry of Public Health Afghanistan to combat AMR.

In Afghanistan because of war and some other political issues the borders of the country are not  well  secured and  well  controlled  therefore control  of  smuggling  of medicine  is  a  big challenge  in  front  of  the  rational  use  of  medicine.  Lack  of  knowledge  (professionals  and public), poor economic state, conflict of war, presence of remote areas and etc…. are the other main challenges for this to won the battle of combating AMR.

Misuse and over use of ATB is very common among the society, everyone is able to buy ATB and  other  medicine  without  prescription.  In  majority  of  cases  professionals  prescribe without proper diagnosis and in every prescription you can see ATB at first line and even two or three Antibiotics as combination,

Smuggling and inappropriate or inadequate quality control of drug, caused presence of big number poor quality medicine in the markets, there for it may cause long term treatment, failure of treatments and finally Antibiotics resistance.

Other big issue is unsafe and insecure transportation of medicine, lot of companies using nonstandard containers and stocks, which facilitates the appearance of medicine to high degree of temperature.

MoPH Afghanistan highlights the problem of antimicrobial resistance and calls for a rapid standardization of guidelines regarding antibiotic use, limiting the use of antibiotics as over the  counter  medications,  banning  or  restricting  the  inclusive  usage  of  antibiotic  in  the hospital and community.

In  addition,  the  MoPH  has  also  identified  AMR  as  one  of  the  key  strategic  priorities. Therefore, we are committed to implement, monitor and evaluate the NAP - AMR in our country.

## 1.1. Introduction

In May 2014, the World Health Assembly requested the development of a global action plan (GAP) on antimicrobial resistance, in resolution WHA67.25, reflecting a global consensus that antimicrobial resistance poses a profound threat to human health.

The WHO secretariat led the development of the Global Action Plan on AMR (GAP-AMR) that takes into account the commitment, perspectives and roles of all relevant stakeholders. And in  which everyone has clear and shared ownership and responsibilities. In May 2015, the sixty-eight  world  Health Assembly endorsed GAP- AMR to tackle antimicrobial resistance including antibiotic resistance, the most urgent drug resistance trend. The WHO resolution also requests Member States to align their national action plans with GAP-AMR by May 2017.

The Global Action Plan on AMR provides a broad framework for combating AMR. The of GAPAMR is to ensure, for as long as possible, continuity of successful treatment and prevention of infectious diseases with effective and safe medicines that are quality assured, used in a responsible way, and accessible to all who need them. The FAO Acton Plan on AMR has 4 strategic objectives that are aligned with GAP-AMR.

To achieve it is goal, the global action plan sets out five strategic objectives, to:

- 1. Improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance;
- 2. Strengthen knowledge throw surveillance and research;
- 3. Reduce the incidence of infection;
- 4. Optimize the use of antimicrobial agents in health, animal and food sectors; and
- 5. Develop the  economic  case  for  sustainable  investment  that  takes  account  of  the needs of all countries, and increase investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions.

The strategic objectives of the NAP-AMR are aligned to the GAP-AMR based on notional needs and priorities.

## 1.2. AMR and its containment in Afghanistan

## 1.2.1. AMR in man and animals

The  AMR  is  a  major  public  health  concern  in  Afghanistan.  Some  small  steps  are  getting towards containment of AMR like some Infection prevention and control programs in some tertiary  hospitals  of  some  cities,  and  preparing  some  treatment  guidelines  for  some hospitals,  this  framework  will  serve  as  a  starting  point  for  cohesive  engagement  and mobilization of all who are accountable for action on antimicrobial resistance and use. Given

the  global  nature  of  this  issue,  the  Action  Plan,  in  line  with  the  one  -  health  concept, highlights the need for Afghanistan to work with international organization and groups to develop solutions applicable to domestic production and use and importation from global market.

## 1.2.2. Awareness and understanding of AMR

The GAP-AMR states that the first strategic objective in effectively containing AMR is to improve awareness and understanding of AMR through effective communication, education and training. The strategy envisions that the awareness building has to proceed on several fronts at the same time. On one hand it has to leverage public communication programs to encourage  behavior  change  in  target  population-namely  stakeholders  in  human  health, animal  health  and  agriculture;  and  on  the  other  there  needs  to  be  concerted  efforts  to incorporate AMR as core component in the professional education of medical and veterinary professional.

The need to focus on awareness building, both in consumers and providers, was highlighted by the results of the multi country public awareness survey that was conducted by WHO in 2015.

The  finding  of  the  study  highlighted  important  deficits  in  the  understanding  of  what antibiotics are, how they should be used and when to take them. There is ample evidence to suggest  that  there  is  some  pressure  from  patients  which  forces  medical  practitioners  to overprescribe antibiotics, especially for conditions like viral illness, upper respiratory tract infections and diarrhea, for which antibiotic therapies are not the recommended first line of approach.

Given the financial incentives to prescribe antibiotics and the role of the  pharmaceutical industry in encouraging prescription of antibiotics in Afghanistan, there is a need to approach the  process  of  awareness  generation  with  additional  legislative  support.  Internationally there is evidence  that awareness  generation  campaign  in  combination  with other interventions that are organized at the national level may be successful to reduce antibiotic use.

There is also a need to increase the awareness about the need of contain AMR at the higher levels of policy making, so that it may emerge as a priority in the health policies of the nation.

## 1.2.3. Surveillance of AMR

Afghanistan has previously instituted of the emergence of drug resistance in disease causing microbes in the context of vertical programs, like the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP), and the National AIDS Control Program (NACP), to name a few. However, a cross cutting program dealing with antimicrobial resistance across multiple microbes has been lacking.

Historically, AMR has not received adequate focus and attention in Afghanistan. However recent trends clearly illustrate the growing MoPH commitment at the highest levels to have a coherent response in place that can the necessary gravitas for nationwide surveillance and stewardship for containment of AMR. Efforts are also being made to incorporate the one health approach into these plans.

The Ministry of Health has recently notified 3 governance mechanisms towards this - an intersectoral  Coordination  Committee,  a  Technical  Advisory  Group  and  a  Core  Working Group on AMR.

The recent political declaration/UN resolution on AMR fallowing the high level meeting on AMR at the United Nations General Assembly is an opportunity for the technical leadership in  Afghanistan to  leverage  the  current  conducive  policy  environment for  effective  action against AMR.

## 2. Developing the Nation Action Plan on AMR

## 2.1. Governance mechanism

The Government of Afghanistan is strongly committed to tackling AMR in the country and led the global and regional AMR agenda.

Governance mechanisms are essential for effective intersectoral coordination of activities to combat AMR. They are also important to engage key stakeholders in the development of NAP-AMR  to  ensure  their  ownership  during  the  implementation  phase.  Governance mechanisms need political support and authority to take actions, and are more likely to be effective  with  clearly  defined  terms  of  reference.  The  following  AMR  committee/groups (Figure 1) were notified.

Intersectoral coordinating committee

Technical advisory group

Core working group

## 2.1.1. Intersectoral Coordination Committee on AMR

The purpose of Intersectoral Coordination Committee on Antimicrobial Resistance (ICCAMR) is to oversee and coordinate policy decision for activities related to antimicrobial resistance in all sectors in alignment with AMR related public health goals.

The ICC-AMR shall lead and facilitate the coordination of the national (along with sub national and international) response to the threat of AMR; ensure information sharing to  reinforce  AMR-related  activities  among  all  sectors;  review  and  revise  term  of reference of the technical advisory group on AMR; ensure coordination of health system and other sectors to achieve the AMR- related public health goals; facilitate and synergies existing  and  new  initiatives  to  achieve  to  goal  of  combating  AMR  in  Afghanistan; facilitates collaboration with internal and external agencies and organizations for AMRrelated  public  health  activities;  endorse  national  action  plan  on  AMR,  and  ensure adequate  logistic  and  resource  mobilization  to  cover  any  funding  gap;  and  oversee progress of efforts to combat AMR and ensure program planning and implementation.

## 2.1.2. Technical Advisory Group on AMR

The purpose of the Technical Advisory Group on Antimicrobial Resistance (TAG-AMR) shall be to the approach and initiatives for  combating AMR in Afghanistan and make recommendations on technical issues.

The TAG- AMR shall provide technical advice and reports to the ICC- AMR; technically review and revise the draft national action plan on AMR; provide technical oversight for existing and new initiatives to combat AMR in Afghanistan; and review and revise the terms of the core working group on AMR.

## 2.1.3. Core Working Group on AMR

The Core Working Group on Antimicrobial Resistance (CWG- AMR) shall provide technical and  operational  inputs  to  the  designated  national  coordinating  center  for  AMR  in Afghanistan i.e. National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) to develop and implement the National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (NAP- AMR)

The CWG- AMR shall identify and map stakeholders for AMR- related activities; lead the development of the national action plan on AMR in Afghanistan with involvement of all stakeholders;  ensure  regular  data  collection  and  information  sharing;  coordinate national  activities  for  establishing/strengthening  surveillance  systems;  develop  and disseminate  national  AMR  reports;  and  facilitate  and  monitor/evaluate  the  overall implementation of NAP- AMR. The details of these committees/groups are provided in annex  1.  The  Technical  Advisory  Group  and  Core  Working  Group  are  specific  for governance mechanisms in the human health sector. Similar groups are needed in the other sectors to coordinate their response in tackling AMR.

## 3. National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance

## 3.1. Goal

The overarching goal of the National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (NAP-AMR) is to effectively combat antimicrobial resistance in Afghanistan, and contribute towards the  global  efforts  to  tackle  this  public  health  threat.
