## Foreword

In implementing the measures required to combat  antimicrobial resistance, the involvement of all relevant stakeholders is a vital prerequisite for long-term success. The good and constructive cooperation previously shown played a key role in achieving the results obtained in implementing the predecessor versions to this new  strategy,  DART 2030.

Our thanks go to everyone involved in the comments and input process. To the extent possible, the feedback received has been taken into account in devising this latest DART Strategy and/or will be taken up in the subsequent DART 2030 Action Plan.

## Introduction

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR)  is increasing on a global 1 scale, posing an ever-growing challenge in the treatment  of  patients  in  both  human  and  veterinary medicine. Its impact means that only a few or in some cases  no  treatment  options  are  available  in  treating bacterial  infections  that  were  previously  treated  with ease.  In  addition  to  the  personal  suffering  of  those affected, this means  longer  and  significantly  more serious  courses  of  disease,  and  consequently  more deaths.  Also,  many  of  the  achievements  attained  in modern medicine, such as joint replacements, chemotherapy in treating cancer, immunotherapies for rheumatic  disease,  and  neonatal  care  for  premature babies, would be unthinkable without effective antibiotics. AMR  is  also a source of considerable additional costs. These arise, among other things, from the rising costs of treatment, prolonged hospital stays, absences from work and premature deaths.

The increasing  prevalence of resistant pathogens also heightens the  risk  of  emergency  situations  in  treating animals  in  veterinary medical  care. As  our  fellow creatures, all sick animals have a right to receive medical treatment. Where necessary, this also includes administering antibiotics prescribed by a  veterinarian. And  as  animals  are  often  kept  in  close  proximity  to humans,  the  transfer  of  resistant  pathogens  between animal  keepers  and  their  domestic  animals  and  pets poses a growing problem.

The release of antibiotic substances and their metabolites (metabolic products) into the environment from human settlements and animal husbandry upsets the  environmental  balances  in  the  biosphere  and  can promote the distribution of novel resistance mechanisms. The environment can thus be a source of resistant micro-organisms  for humans  and  animals alike.

Preventing the further spread of AMR calls for a package of  measures  which  are  to  be  implemented  in  a  wide range of areas. The Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance adopted by  the  World Health  Assembly in 2015  calls  upon  member  states  to  devise  their  own national action  plans. Taking account of the goals set out  in  the  Global  Action  Plan,  these  national  actions plans are to contain measures which are aligned to the actual situation in each country. The plans also serve in achieving the UN  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The  first  German  Antimicrobial  Resistance  Strategy (DART) was adopted by the Federal Government back in 2008. Like its successor strategy, DART 2020 launched in 2015,  it  took  the  One  Health  approach,  was  jointly developed by the Federal  Ministries of  Health (BMG), Food and Agriculture (BMEL) and Education and Research  (BMBF),  and  subsequently  adopted  by  the Federal Cabinet. A Final Report on the implementation of DART 2020 was published in April 2022.  The report 2 describes  both  the  measures  implemented  to  achieve the DART 2020 goals and the key outcomes - including in relation to resistance rates and antibiotic use. It also sets  out  the  initial  focal  areas  to  be  taken  up  in  this successor strategy, DART 2030.

These focal areas include prevention, further promotion of appropriate use of antibiotics in human and veterinary  medicine,  and  greater  involvement  of  the environment  sector  in  activities  to  combat  AMR.  The situation which has evolved in recent years has further highlighted this sector's increasingly important role.

In  the  area  of  human  medicine,  greater  focus  will  be placed on sepsis - the most severe form of infection. In the  past,  measures  were  initiated  under  DART  2020 whose direct or indirect goal was to prevent both cases of  sepsis  and  deaths  due  to  sepsis.  Via  the  funding

opportunities provided by the Innovation Fund of the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA), scientific studies were enabled  on  the  epidemiology  of  sepsis,  its  long-term effects and the effectiveness of information campaigns for the prevention and early detection of sepsis. There have been repeated calls for a national sepsis plan which would set out a package of effective measures for the prevention and early detection of sepsis, and could be supplemented with additional activities at a later date. In order  to make  the most of the  many interfaces and synergies,  however,  it  was  decided  not  to  develop  a standalone national sepsis plan. Targeted measures to combat sepsis will be  taken  up  as  part  of  DART  2030 instead.

The future AMR Strategy will also consider outpatient medical care. Given that it involves both the prescription of more than 80 percent of antibiotics used and  the  vast  majority  of  patients  being  treated  with respiratory and urinary tract infections, the outpatient healthcare sector  represents  an  important  area  in  the national AMR Strategy, among other things because its processes  in  diagnostics  and  treatment  differ  greatly from those involved in providing inpatient care. This is where the future development of an outpatient antibiotic  stewardship  strategy  will  play  an  important role by focusing on the specificities and needs of general practitioner and paediatric primary care, outpatient care and dental care.

DART  2030  was  jointly developed  by  the  Federal Ministry of Health (BMG), the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL), the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and, new to the group, the  Federal  Ministry  for  Economic  Cooperation  and Development  (BMZ).  The  Federal  Ministry  for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection (BMUV) was also involved in the

review.  The  main  areas  of  focus  in  the  predecessor version, DART 2020, remain valid and in place: expansion of the surveillance  and  monitoring systems on AMR and antibiotic use, improvements in infection prevention  and  appropriate  use  of  antibiotics,  raising public awareness, facilitating the acquisition of necessary knowledge among medical professionals, and intensifying  R&amp;D support -  the One Health approach being taken into account in each case.

As the Strategy's planned lifecycle runs up to 2030 and it is impossible to say which measures and steps will be needed or require alignment to achieve its set goals, a two-step approach is taken.  This report sets out both the  goals  to  be  achieved  by  the  end  of  the  Strategy's lifecycle, and  from what starting  points, in combating AMR - both at national level and through international cooperation.  In  a  second  step,  an  action  plan  to  be published at a later date will set out the measures and steps  required  to  achieve  the  DART  2030  goals.  The action plan will be regularly reviewed and realigned as needed. It will also be used as the basis for reporting on the status of DART 2030 implementation. As with DART 2020, this will continue the tried and trusted process of issuing regular interim reports.

Reporting on the progress made in achieving the overarching goals for AMR reduction in human medicine is  to  be  aided  by  the  setting  of  suitable  targets.  In  the course of Germany's G7 presidency in 2022, the G7 health ministers  agreed  to  define  measurable  national-level AMR targets by the end of 2023 which also cover the use of antibiotics. By including targets in DART  2030, Germany has followed through on this commitment. It is envisaged  that  the  targets  will  be  presented  with  the action  plan.  Progress  made  in  target  achievement  will also  be  addressed  as  part  of  the  planned  reporting process.

## Action Area 1: Prevention

This  action  area  takes  in  the  prevention  of  infectious diseases requiring treatment using infection protection and control measures (as understood in their broadest sense) to reduce both the use of antibiotics and selection  pressure  in  microorganisms.  Prevention  also includes containing the emergence and spread of AMR in and via the environment (such as through wastewater, waterbodies and soil) and preventing the spread of AMR along the food chain.

## 1.1. Human medicine and nursing care

In  the  human  medicine  sector,  the  Commission  for Hospital Hygiene and Infection Prevention (KRINKO) at the RKI draws up recommendations aimed, among other things,  at  preventing  nosocomial  infections  in  medical facilities.  The  available  recommendations  cover  all  key thematic areas, thereby providing valuable guidance for the prevention of infectious diseases in medical facilities. They are subject to regular review, and are adapted and realigned as needed. The Act to strengthen the protection of  the  population  and  in  particular  vulnerable  groups against COVID-19 (Gesetz zur Stärkung des Schutzes der Bevölkerung und insbesondere vulnerabler Personengruppen  vor  COVID-19),  which  entered  into force in September 2022, expanded the area of responsibility of the new  Commission  for  Infection Prevention  in  Medical  Facilities  and  in  Facilities  and Companies  of  Care  and  Integration  (Kommission  für Infektionsprävention in medizinischen Einrichtungen und in Einrichtungen  und  Unternehmen  der  Pflege  und Eingliederungshilfe). In the future, recommendations are also to be drawn up for such facilities and companies, and their needs adequately taken into account in measures to prevent infection.

Recommendations and guidelines on hygiene and infection prevention must be provided, observed, applied and evaluated in the facilities. Obstacles that hinder their implementation  must  be  identified  and  eliminated.  As part  of  this  process,  the  findings  of  ongoing  research projects are to be used as a basis on which to develop additional, targeted measures. As in promoting appropriate  use  of  antibiotics  in  human  medicine  (see 3.1), the various medical associations also play an

important role in improving both the implementation and acceptance of measures concerning hygiene and infection prevention.

Likewise,  awareness  of  infection  prevention  and  the resulting potential cost reduction must be secured at all levels in both medical and care facilities. Only then can a long-term, positive effect be expected as regards the rate of infections requiring treatment.

Vaccination  is  an  important  and  effective  means  of preventing  infection.  Preventing  infections  and  serious cases  of  infectious  disease  makes  it  possible  to  reduce antibiotic resistance. This also includes viral infections in which  bacterial  superinfections  often  lead  to  severe courses  of  disease.  The  National  Vaccination  Schedule sets  out  Germany's  vaccination  targets.  The  Schedule's consistent, determined implementation can also help to reduce both the emergence and spread of AMR. Vaccinations likewise play an important role in preventing sepsis  infection  and  vaccines  are  available  for  certain pathogens that are known to cause sepsis. Worthy of note in this regard are pneumococcal and influenza vaccines. The aim is thus to further increase the number of people who are  vaccinated,  especially  among  risk  patients  and vulnerable groups.

## 1.2. Animal health

Animal husbandry conditions, systems and management all have a significant impact on the health of animals and livestock. Existing husbandry and management processes must  thus  be  subjected  to  critical  review  to  assess whether they foster infectious disease, thereby increasing the need to use antibiotics. To promote animals' resistance to disease and reduce the pressure of infection, animal husbandry and management processes are to be modified where necessary, taking prevailing animal health and welfare requirements into account.

Animal  nutrition  also  has  a  significant  impact  on  an animal's  resilience  to  disease.  The  potential  impact  of needs-based animal nutrition containing both macro and micronutrients, a balanced supply of fibre and a suitable feed structure (which is essential) should not be

underestimated.  Additional  measures  that  can  play  a highly important role include feed hygiene (elimination/ reduction  of  antinutritive  and  toxic substances,  and harmful organisms) and the use of feed components with beneficial  effects  on  the  physiological  function  of  the digestive  tract  and  its  microbiome,  and  on  animals' immune status.

In both animal husbandry and animal transport, consistent use of hygiene, animal welfare and biosafety measures is needed. This reduces the infection pressure in the animal environment, thereby reducing the risk of infection.

Vaccination measures serve not only direct prevention of infection with the specific pathogens they target - they also protect against secondary diseases, thereby improving  animals'  general  immunity  and  reducing  the frequency of bacterial infections that have to be treated with antibiotics.

Animal breeding can also help to improve the vitality and robustness of animals, and increase genetic diversity. This means  that  healthy,  robust  animals  are  less  at  risk  of infection. Genetically heterogeneous  populations  are better  able  to  resist  pathogens.  In  animal  breeding, functional traits such as health and robustness are gaining in importance, and can be included in  the breeding value estimation  of  animals.  Use  of  genomic selection  in breeding value estimation, which has been practiced for some years, further promotes the breeding of improved functional traits.

## 1.3. Environmental release of antibiotics and antibiotic resistances

There are still considerable gaps in available knowledge regarding the extent and importance of the environmental release of antibiotic substances and their metabolites,  and  of  antibiotic  resistant  bacteria  and resistance genes via wastewater, household waste, stable dust,  slurry,  solid  manure  and  fermentation  substrate. Current knowledge must nonetheless be used to critically assess the existing practices applied in wastewater treatment, farming and commercial processing of food as to their role in the occurrence and especially the spread of AMR, with alternatives being developed as needed. In the area of livestock husbandry, when  developing strategies to prevent the environmental release of antibiotics  and  resistances,  other  needs  such  as  animal welfare,  organic  farming  and  sustainable  management practices must also be considered.

## 1.4. Food chain

ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli are also being detected in agricultural livestock (poultry, pigs and cattle). Sampling carried out during monitoring of zoonoses at retail level repeatedly detects foods contaminated with multidrugresistant pathogens (MDROss) being displayed on sale to consumers. It can thus be assumed that those pathogens can be transmitted via food. The importance of  the  role  of  food  and  livestock  as  sources  of  MDRO infections  in  humans  cannot  be  adequately  estimated using  available  data.  It  can  be  assumed  that  it  differs between  the  different  types  of  bacteria  and  is  not particularly significant in a large number of cases. Further efforts are nonetheless needed in order to minimise their role.

Resistance determinants enter the food chain via livestock husbandry, humans and the environment, and can be  either  eliminated or further transmitted once in the  chain.  As  well  as  foods  of  animal  origin,  this  also affects plant-based  foods.  The  release  of  resistance determinants  into  the  food  chain  can  be  prevented among other things through the detection of survival and adaptation strategies of (antibiotic resistant) bacteria and their distribution paths, and any existing contamination of food  can  be  reduced  by  means  of  suitable  practices  of processing and treatment.

## Action Area 2: Surveillance and Monitoring

Standardised and uniform surveillance and monitoring of antibiotic use and AMR are needed to assess the situation in all healthcare sectors (including primary care, outpatient specialist care and dental care), identify changes, progresses and trends, and then use the findings to implement targeted measures and track their effects. The  methods  used,  planning  of  targeted  monitoring activities and both the evaluation and reporting of results are all subject to continuous development.

## 2.1. Systems used in human and veterinary medicine

In Germany, data on AMR in human medicine is collated in  the  antibiotic  resistance  surveillance  system  (ARS) established at the RKI. Via feedback reports, the participating laboratories receive an overview of resistance  at the  local level along  with  information concerning rare resistances. For antibiotic use in inpatient care,  the  RKI's  antibiotic  use  surveillance  system  (AVS) can be used in addition to various other systems. The AVS also serves to assist inpatient facilities in implementing the legal requirements set out in the Protection Against Infection Act (IfSG) regarding documentation and evaluation of data on antibiotic use. Use of antibiotics in the  outpatient  setting  is  documented  as  a  rule  by  the statutory  health  insurance  funds.  To  further  improve available data, efforts should be made to harmonise the surveillance  systems. Also, to be able to arrive at more detailed  conclusions  on  the  prevalence  and  spread  of AMR,  the  national  surveillance  systems  for  both  the outpatient and  inpatient settings should  be further developed and enhanced. Resistance data on fungi should also be included. Additional data sources, including those available in the various Länder (Federal states) and those concerning  specific  pathogens  -  such  as  the  national reference centres (NRC), the consulting laboratories (CL), scientific societies and projects -are also to be considered. In the future, the German Electronic Reporting and Information System for Infection Protection  and  Control  (DEMIS)  will  play  an  important role in surveillance.

In  particular  with  regard  to  reserve  antibiotics  under Section  35a  (1c)  of  Book  V  of  the  German  Social  Code (SGB V), it is important -via the RKI's existing

surveillance systems on antibiotic resistance and antibiotics use - to be able to obtain a general overview of resistance developments and trends (taking account of antibiotic use) in order to identify unfavourable trends at an  early stage  and  implement  the  countermeasures needed.

Both the inclusion of clinical patient information and the nationwide collection of outpatient resistance data sorted by primary and secondary care is also to be promoted to aid  the  development  of  targeted  recommendations  for treatment.

In addition  to  improving  the  availability  of  data  at national  level,  expanding  the  surveillance  systems  will enable Germany to better comply with reporting requirements in the EU's European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) and European  Surveillance  of  Antimicrobial  Consumption Network (ESAC-Net), and also in the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS).

Molecular  biological  studies  on  pathogens  are  a  key instrument  used  in,  for  example,  detecting  resistance genes  in  AMR  and  tracing  infection  chains  -  especially concerning (super-regional) outbreaks of disease. When establishing an integrated molecular surveillance system, i.e. linking genome data of pathogens with data from the reporting system in accordance with the IfSG, a molecular surveillance system is also to be established for antibiotic-resistant pathogens  of  special importance, including 4MRGN  (multidrug-resistant  gram-negative pathogens with resistance to four antibiotic groups) and MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus).

Conducting  molecular  studies  using  standardised  and harmonised processes is a prerequisite for the collation of sequence data on resistant pathogens from the human, veterinary  and  environmental  sectors.  This  approach enables  both  better  tracing  and  verification  of  crosssectoral infection chains, and subsequent conclusions to be  drawn  on  the  spread  of  resistances  across  sectors. Cross-sectoral  cooperation and joint evaluation of data

from  the  surveillance  and  monitoring  systems  is  to  be gradually expanded.

Current antibiotic resistance monitoring along the food chain, in which the Länder (states), the Federal Institute for  Risk  Assessment  (BfR)  and  the  Federal  Office  of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL) are involved, is to be continued. In addition to alignment to the new EU legislative requirements (Implementing Decision (EU) 2020/1729),  supplementary  national  programmes  will also be implemented, further developed and enhanced.

National antibiotic resistance monitoring of animal pathogenic bacteria will likewise be continued and further developed by the BVL. Efforts will also be made to centrally collect and analyse more data on AMR from diagnostic  studies  conducted  by  testing  laboratories  of the Länder and private laboratories. That data is intended to enable both early identification of specific resistance patterns and subsequent implementation of further targeted studies as needed.

With  effect from  2023, Regulation (EU) 2019/6  on Veterinary Medicinal Products regulates EU-wide documentation  of  the  quantities  of  antibiotics  sold  for use  in  animals  (sales  data)  and  of  the  actual  quantities used.  Germany  already  has  documentation  systems  in place for both quantities and this must now be aligned with the provisions of the EU Regulation. In particular, the phased documentation required in the EU Regulation of the quantities used for all food-producing animals as well as horses, dogs and cats can only be implemented by means of a significant increase in the digital workload of veterinarians, animal keepers and competent authorities. This will enable data on antibiotic use in animals to be obtained separately according to animal species and type of  production.  In  particular,  the  use  and  the  effects  of certain antibiotic substances that play an important role in human medicine, such as colistin, fluoroquinolones and third  and  fourth  generation  cephalosporins,  are  to  be subjected to especially critical monitoring.

Data from both resistance monitoring programmes in the veterinary sector, the documented quantities of antibiotics  and  information  on  trends  in  the  treatment frequencies  in  livestock  farms  subject  to  the  national antibiotics minimisation  concept  are  key  sources  of information that can be used  in national-level risk assessment and in developing management measures. To make the findings more easily accessible, reporting and analysis systems for routine analysis of data and also webbased  systems  will  be  developed  and  implemented  for use.  Opportunities  arising  from  increasing  digitalisation will be leveraged in the process.

Currently, there remains a lack of systematically collected, representative data on the spread of AMR in and  via  the  environment.  This  knowledge  gap  must  be closed. When considering the establishment of an official system to monitor antibiotic resistance in the environment,  the  longstanding  experience  in  resistance monitoring in the veterinary sector, the related cooperation between the Federal and Länder governments,  and  the  collective  experience  gained  in monitoring  wastewater  for  SARS-CoV-2  must  all  be drawn upon and used.

## 2.2. Integrated One Health surveillance

Integrated analysis of resistance data from surveillance in environment,  veterinary  and  human  medicine  is  a  key prerequisite for fact-based, cross-sectoral assessment of the resistance situation in Germany and plays an important role in the One Health approach to combating AMR.

Under Germany's G7 presidency in 2022, the G7 health and agriculture ministers agreed to establish and expand integrated  surveillance  systems  on  AMR  and  antibiotic use  in  the  human  and  veterinary  sectors  as  well  as  in agriculture and  the environment.  Establishing those systems  calls  for  a  phased  approach  in  which,  among other things, it is necessary to decide how to deal with differing  data  formats  and  comply  with  differing  data protection  provisions.  Initial  steps  have  already  been taken in the course of research projects conducted over the past few  years. The  long-term  goal  is to link (molecular) data from the human, veterinary and environment sectors with epidemiological, social medicine and other subject-relevant data, and generate a broad data resource to aid targeted interventions.

## 2.3. Additional data collection

Targeted questions that go beyond standardised evaluation  of  surveillance  and  monitoring  data  can  be addressed  by  means  of  dedicated  studies  and  research projects.  In  the  human  medicine  sector,  this  especially involves regular surveys initiated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) - for example, the  national  part  of  an  EU  point  prevalence  study  on, among other things, the incidence of nosocomial infections and antibiotic use in hospitals and long-term care facilities. In the  food  safety  sector,  it involves participation  in  studies  coordinated  by  the  European Food  Safety  Authority  (EFSA)  on  the  occurrence  of resistant microorganisms in the food chain, such as MRSA in livestock and food. Germany will continue to participate in the EU surveys and use the resulting trends as  a  basis  on  which  to  adapt  and  align  measures  at national level.

## Action Area 3: Appropriate Use of Antibiotics including Laboratory Diagnostics

Antibiotic stewardship (ABS) is designed to ensure both indication-appropriate  use  of  antibiotics  and  the  best possible  antibiotic  treatment,  and  help  to  reduce  or prevent increasing development of resistance. ABS takes in  reliable  diagnostics,  selection  of  a  suitable  antibiotic and  its  fastest-possible  use  (especially  on  suspicion  of sepsis), and adequate recommendations concerning indication, treatment duration, antibiotic dosage, dosage form and reevaluation. The aim is to establish responsible use and handling of antibiotics by general practitioners, dentists and veterinarians - including regular reflection on their own actions and behaviours - and make these standard  practice.  Mandatory  further  training  measures are to be reviewed along with adequate teaching of the topic in medical studies, including knowledge of alternative options for treatment. In some cases, it may also make sense to develop dedicated models for certain types of livestock farming.

## 3.1. Antibiotic use in human medicine

In ABS activities, data analyses that compare resistance rates with antibiotic use can be of great assistance and help identify how they influence each other. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) has developed the ARVIA system for use in inpatient treatment and care. ARVIA is a German acronym  for  Integrated  Antimicrobial  Resistance  and Consumption Analysis. It highlights potential dependencies between the resistance situation and antibiotic prescriptions, and can help in aligning treatment recommendations and treatment practices in the field. The aim now is to establish this system and gain a comprehensive,  uniform  overview  of  the  data  for Germany by means of constructive cooperation with the treating physicians, coordination with experts responsible for ABS and by merging data from the differing systems already in place.

Up-to-date, evidence-based guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases and cases of sepsis which can be attributed to the resistance situation are a further prerequisite  for ABS. Needs-oriented guidelines can only be developed if current and disaggregated care data is available. The aim is to have and keep up to date a catalogue  of  infectiological  S3  guidelines  for  each  care

setting in the guidelines register of the Association of the Scientific Medical  Societies  in  Germany    (AWMF)  including explicitly for primary and secondary outpatient care and dental care. The respective treating disciplines and their institutions must be closely involved in developing the catalogue. An important contribution can be made here by the funding opportunities provided by the Innovation Fund of the Federal Joint Committee (GBA) and by the issuing of evidence search requests to the Institute for Quality and  Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) by the Federal Ministry of Health (BMG) at the recommendation of the AWMF. Additionally, it must be ensured that guidelines are actually applied and followed in practice. To aid this process, various forms of evaluation  and  also  strategies  must  be  developed  in cooperation with relevant stakeholders. This also includes  setting  out  the  content  of  the  guidelines  in concise, user-friendly form. Adherence to the guidelines can be ensured by putting in place the prerequisites for implementation  of  ABS  programmes  (such  as  quality indicators and  information  technology),  strategies  to optimise prescribing behaviour (such as ABS rounds and further and continuous  training), and  strategies for treatment  optimisation (such as evaluation of antiinfective treatments).

Data on AMR and on antibiotic use in human medicine, and  also  the  guideline  catalogue  should  be  regularly provided to the Commission on Anti-Infectives, Resistance  and  Therapy  (ART)  at  the  RKI.  In  this  way, priorities can be set in guideline development  and alignment. The ART draws up recommendations, setting out  basic  principles  for  diagnostics  and  antimicrobial treatments, especially for infections involving resistance pathogens. It also reports on appropriate conditions for and on obstacles to implementation of appropriate antiinfective treatment, and proposes practical solutions. The ART's role and area of responsibility are to be reviewed, made clearer and better aligned to actual requirements in the future.

When  it  comes  to  appropriate  use  of  antibiotics,  the availability  of  sufficiently  qualified  personnel  also  plays an important role. At the 124th Medical Assembly held in

2021, it was decided to introduce stand-alone specialist further training in  'Internal Medicine and Infectiology' within the field of internal medicine in Germany. Additional further training in infectiology is also open to all  physicians  who  have  successfully  completed  further training in an area involving immediate patient care or in microbiology, virology and infectious disease epidemiology or in hygiene and environmental medicine. The  new  further  training  opportunities  will  help  to promote infectiology expertise in human medicine.

By means  of  intensive further training programmes offered by the specialist associations, it was ensured that all 'ABS Representatives' or 'ABS Experts' possess a very good and current level of knowledge. Given the differing conditions  and  requirements  in  hospitals,  care  facilities and medical practices, the various models already in place must  be  reviewed  and  optimised  where  needed.  To improve ABS implementation, efforts should be made to expand  the  further  training  opportunities  available  in both inpatient and outpatient care. This also calls for the expansion of a nationwide network of infectiology expertise  and  with  it  the  expansion  of  further  training opportunities and capacities, especially in paediatric and adolescent infectiology.

Pharmacists  with  specialist  training  in  infectiology  or ABS-trained clinical pharmacists are an integral component  of  multidisciplinary  ABS  teams  in  German hospitals  and  play  an  important  role  in  ensuring  the appropriate use of antibiotics.

Another key factor in ensuring appropriate use of antibiotics  comprises  regular  reviews  of  how  ABS  is implemented.  The  monitoring  authorities  must  thus possess the knowledge needed. Training measures must be introduced.

To  bridge  the  gap  in  the  meantime,  innovative,  data protection compliant telemedicine communications processes must also be developed which ensure that the infectiology expertise available  in university hospitals is also  made  available  to  non-university  hospitals  in  rural regions.

By promoting infectiology expertise, positive effects can be expected with regard to early detection and treatment of  sepsis.  This could  help  in  achieving  a  long-term reduction in the high sepsis mortality rates in hospitals in Germany compared with those in countries with similarly well-developed  healthcare  systems.  In  the  future,  the Federal  Government  and  the  Länder  must  introduce suitable measures to ensure adequate staffing of medical

facilities with doctors and pharmacists who are trained in infectiology.

Outpatient care accounts for approximately 85 percent of antibiotic prescriptions. It thus plays a significant role in promoting appropriate use of antibiotics. To be effective, therefore, structures and measures must take account of the specific needs and requirements in outpatient care. Among  other  things,  this  calls  for  guidelines  covering relevant diseases in outpatient care, hygiene, diagnostics and treatment options, and monitoring of antibiotic use via a feedback  mechanism  specially  devised  for  the outpatient sector. This would enable a comparison to be drawn between a physician's own prescription behaviour and that of other representatives of the same specialist discipline, and indicate areas where changes can be made. The aim is to expand antibiotic use surveillance to take in the  entire  outpatient  care  sector  and  enable  facilityspecific feedback. A system which has already been tried and tested as part of a feasibility study is to be established at the RKI and implemented nationwide.

Based on the results of a number of research projects that looked at the prerequisites for promoting appropriate use of antibiotics in outpatient care, further measures are to be introduced and established for the longer term. In the course of that process, national and regional specificities must  be  taken  into  account.  Although  antibiotic  use  in Germany is low, broad-spectrum and reserve antibiotics are  prescribed  comparatively  frequently,  and  regional differences are also evident in the frequency of antibiotic prescription and the antibiotics chosen. Outpatient ABS should be developed and established that takes account of the specificities of outpatient care. The specific needs of paediatric care must also be considered.

The  measures  in  the  inpatient  and  outpatient  sectors should  be interconnected  to eliminate problems  of overlapping and, for example, to make better use of the benefits of outpatient parenteral antibiotic treatment. In addition, efforts should be taken to establish a joint, webbased continuing training platform for doctors.

Antibiotics  are  also  frequently  used  in  residential  care homes.  Suitable  measures  are  thus  needed  to  promote their appropriate use in the provision of primary care.

In recent years, various unforeseeable events have highlighted  the  vulnerability  of  global  supply  chains  to bottlenecks  in  delivery  and  shortfalls  in  supply.  The strong  focus  on  production  sites  of  older,  generic  but medically indispensable antibiotics in Asia meant that the supply of antibiotics was exponentially affected. There is a  growing  risk  that,  in  the  future,  delivery  bottlenecks

could  result  in the  need  for  greater  use  of  broadspectrum  antibiotics,  which  in  turn  would  negatively impact resistance developments and trends. Measures to minimise this risk, such as relocating production sites of essential  antibiotics  to  the  EU,  must  be  evaluated  and pursued.

A  general  trend  can,  however,  be  observed  whereby approvals of 'older' antibiotics used in human medicine which  are  essential  in  treating  bacterial  infections  are being  withdrawn  because  it  no  longer  pays  to  market those drugs. Strategies must thus be developed which can be used to combat this trend while still ensuring both the availability of those antibiotics and their use in guidelinecompliant treatment.

## 3.2. Antibiotic use in veterinary medicine

Taking  account  of  the  knowledge  gleaned  from  its evaluation, the antibiotics minimisation concept for livestock farms is being continuously further developed and  expanded  to  include  other  animal  categories  and production  types.  The  express  aim  of  the  antibiotics minimisation concept revised at the end of 2022 is to help further reduce the quantity of antibiotics used in animals by  50    %  between  2018  and  2030,  as  set  out  in  the European  Commission's  Grean  Deal  and  Farm  to  Fork Strategy.  The  Federal  Government  thus  continues  to pursue  the  goal  of  reducing  the  use  of  antibiotics  in veterinary medicine to the medically necessary minimum while safeguarding animal health and welfare.

In the cases of fluorochinolones, third and fourth generation  cephalosporines  and  colistin,  the  aim  is  to further reduce the quantities used in veterinary medicine to the unavoidable minimum. This objective is served, for example, by the inclusion of a legally-defined weighting factor which, when veterinary medicinal products containing  these  active  substances  are  used  in  foodproducing animals, is included in the calculation of the treatment  frequencies  for  food-producing  animals  and increases its value compared to other antibiotics that are less critical for the treatment of humans. This provides an important incentive for veterinarians and livestock keepers  to  largely  refrain  from  using  these  substances. The use in food-producing animals of veterinary medicinal products for oral administration which contain the active substance colistin is to be further restricted by means of a new provision in the Ordinance on Veterinary In-house  Dispensaries  (Verordnung  über  tierärztliche Hausapotheken).

The component of 'monitoring' antibiotic use in further animal populations is established in the antibiotics minimisation concept. On the one hand, these are areas

in which, based on previous experience, low to moderate use of antibiotics can be assumed (e.g. in fattening cattle over the age of 12 months) or where high resistance rates have not been observed so far. On the other, the use will be documented in small farms where animals and animal groups  are  kept,  which  fall  under the  provisions  of  the national  antibiotics  minimisation  concept,  but  are  not included in the benchmarking due to the low numbers of animals kept. Thus, as part of the BfR reporting, developments and trends in antibiotic use in these animal populations  will  also  be  recorded  and  subsequently evaluated  in  terms  of  the  total  quantity  used  and  any changes  made  in  substance  selection.  This  will  enable early  recognition  of  a  need  to  include  further  livestock farms in the antibiotics minimisation concept.

The Federal Veterinary Surgeons' Association (Bundestierärztekammer, BTK) guidelines on the prudent use of antibiotics summarise  the status of current veterinary medical science on responsible use of antibiotics. The guidelines are regularly reviewed for their currentness and revised as needed. Advancing digitalisation  also  provides  an  opportunity  to  develop easily accessible online tools which can assist the use of the guidelines in decisions on treating individual animals and livestock herds.

Linking slaughterhouse findings with animal-specific data from  livestock  farms,  with  laboratory  diagnostics  data (including data from susceptibility tests) and data from veterinary treatments (especially antibiotics) is a valuable tool in assessing animal health in livestock herds. It assists animal keepers in their decision-making regarding farm management, their own on-farm controls and adopting good farming practice. Linking of this data also gives the treating  veterinarian  important  information  to  aid  their decisions as regards treatment and adapting prevention and  treatment  plans.  This  also  includes  advising  the farmer with the aim of improving general animal health and reducing antibiotic use. If the competent authority is also given access to this data, it could improve both the efficiency of and benefits to be had from official controls for authorities, animal keepers and veterinarians, particularly in connection with the antibiotics minimisation concept.

## 3.3. Laboratory diagnostics

Professional microbiological laboratory diagnostics equipped with adequate technology is essential in identifying infection-causing bacteria and their resistance traits. Knowledge on pathogens and antibiotic resistance enables targeted (as opposed to calculated) antimicrobial treatment. It serves as the basis for responsible antibiotic use.  In  addition  to  preventing  resistance  selection  and

undesired side-effects, improved, targeted treatment in human medicine will also reduce the lethality of sepsis.

Laboratory diagnostics is also indispensable in surveillance and monitoring. Methodological gaps are to be closed yet further, existing methods enhanced and, in areas where methods are still lacking, evaluation criteria developed to enable their integration into routine diagnostics. Through the use of suitable instruments, it must also be ensured that rapid microbiological diagnostics  are  made  widely  available  to  healthcare institutions.  This  applies  in  particular  to  the  further development of point of care testing (POCT), which can greatly assist rational antibiotic treatment in outpatient human medicine.

Digitalisation  makes  it  possible  to  conduct  centralised evaluations of the results of pathogen identification tests and antibiograms performed in routine diagnostics. This applies  at  the  level  of  hospital,  care  facility,  medical practice  and  livestock  herd,  as  well  as  at  regional  and national level.

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) plays an important role  in  targeted  management  of  antibiotic  treatment (preventing toxicity through overdosage and development of resistances through underdosage). Antibiotic level determination should thus be available to in-house hospital laboratory diagnostics for the purpose of treatment monitoring.

Collaboration between medical microbiology and clinical departments should also be further intensified to make the new molecular biological opportunities for improved treatments accessible in practice.

## Action Area 4: Communication and Cooperation

This  action  area  covers  dissemination  of  knowledge  to create  and  maintain fact-based  public  awareness  of infections, the link between  non-targeted  antibiotic treatment and AMR,  and  the relationship between infectious  disease  and  the  development  of  sepsis  as  a complication. It also covers knowledge dissemination in and by specialist groups, including in medical training primarily further and continuing training. Added to this is exchange between stakeholders in all participating sectors and interest groups. In addition to new findings from  research  and  development,  knowledge  gaps  and issues are also to be discussed, the aim being to create incentives  for  collaborative  and  transnational  research with a focus on practical application. To ensure successful implementation of the Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy, cooperation between all stakeholders is of vast importance.

## 4.1. Cooperation and the One Health approach

At Federal Government level, the Interministerial Working Group on Antimicrobial Resistance (IMAG AMR) is responsible for cross-ministerial coordination, alignment and expansion of the AMR Strategy. The IMAG AMR comprises the ministries BMG, BMEL, BMBF, BMUV and BMZ, as well as authorities in those ministries' remits. Over time, the group of participants has been extended in the face of additional needs, for example in relation to the environment, the role of plants in addressing AMR, and research and development of new antibiotics. Cooperation between the members of the IMAG AMR has proven valuable and is to be continued. Their work will place  even  greater  focus  on  coordinating  DART  2030 measures and monitoring their implementation. Exchange is also to take place with the respective Länderspecific committees.

In a range of studies, new molecular methodologies have been used to investigate the roles played by human and veterinary medicine and by agriculture in the emergence and spread of AMR. In those studies, it became clear that the exchange of resistant pathogens between these three areas occurred less frequently than had previously been assumed, that the interrelationships are extremely complex  and  that  each  area  has  its  own  resistance

problems.  But  in many  cases, the interrelationships between the three areas remain characterised by insufficient insight into each other's needs. To improve this situation, a format for dialogue and exchange is to be developed and introduced. Because not only in state-run facilities,  but  also  for  doctors  practicing  in  human  and veterinary  medicine,  and  the  respective  representative associations, communication as equal partners along the lines  of  'talking  to  rather  than  about  each  other'  can foster understanding for the various activities, relationships  and  problems,  eliminate  prejudices  and close knowledge gaps.

## 4.2. Specialist groups

In diverse projects, studies have looked at the measures deemed suitable in reducing inappropriate use of antibiotics in outpatient human medicine. As part of that work, informational material was developed for medical and pharmaceutical staff, and for patients. This is to be made readily available to a broad (specialist) public and kept current as part of the process. An assessment is also to be made as to whether the existing material should be supplemented  with  additional  information.  Along  with content  focusing  on  specific  settings,  such  as  patientdoctor consultations, informational material can also be useful which illustrates the interactions between human and veterinary medicine, agriculture and the environment in  the  emergence  and  spread  of  resistance,  fostering mutual understanding as a result.

The  development  of  additional  materials,  publications and training content should thus involve the respective specialist groups. These are key players in the transfer of knowledge  to  clinical  inpatient  and  outpatient  care. Communication should also be intensified between the various organ-specific specialist disciplines and infectiology.

With  regard  to  'older'  antibiotics,  activities  have  been pursued at EU level for a number of years to reevaluate and revise specialist information, especially where approved  indications  and  dosages  are  concerned.  The specialist information also describes the resistance situation  in  Germany  concerning  a  range  of  approved

antibiotics, the  aim  being  to  simplify  the  choice  of suitable  antibiotics  for  calculated  treatment  in  human medicine. The combination of current, reliable resistance data on antibiotics for frequent infectious diseases - and improved, digital access to that data - is intended to assist in shifting prescription behaviour among doctors towards more  rational  use  of  antibiotics.  An  assessment  is  thus needed as to how the current national resistance situation can  be  portrayed  in  the  specialist  information  for  all antibiotics and how  that information can be used efficiently and effectively by prescribing physicians.

In 'Regional MDRO Networks' coordinated by the public health  administration,  hospitals,  rehabilitation  centres, residential  care  homes  and  private  medical  practices collaborate with the aim of containing the further spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens by means of a coordinated regional approach. The networks also serve communication between the various stakeholders. Regional networks have been established in many parts of  Germany.  Given  the  central  role  they  can  play  in dealing with MDRO and the use of antibiotics in a given region, their expansion should be further advanced. The Federal Government and the Länder must thus agree on measures  to  support  that  process.  This  will  require clarification as to whether the regional networks should be expanded to take in additional stakeholders, such as specialised pharmacists, to ensure these goals are achieved.

Early  detection  of  sepsis  symptoms  by  medical  and nursing staff at all levels of patient care, for example in rescue coordination centres and in outpatient and inpatient treatment of people requiring  care, should be improved through the provision of materials for informational purposes and training. In the medium term, knowledge concerning inpatient care in Germany will be supplied  by  the  Federal  Joint  Committee  (G-BA)  in  the course of its consultations on the data-supported quality assurance process for the diagnosis, treatment  and follow-up care of sepsis.

In light of the  knowledge  that  animal  keepers  can significantly influence animal health and thus the use of antibiotics in their animals, communication and cooperation with this group has gained in importance. In this connection, the new EU Animal Health Law assigns veterinarians a communicative  and cooperative role towards animal keepers. Through the provision of modern  informational materials and communication training tools, veterinarians  can  be  assisted  in their mandate to sensitise animal keepers to the topic of AMR. Such  materials  can  also  be  used  in  further  training  for animal  keepers  and  veterinarians.  But  in  addition  to

livestock keepers, pet owners must  also be better reached, educated and informed about how they influence both their animals' health and the development and spread of AMR. The tried and tested communication resources  and  channels  used  by  the  Federal  Centre  for Health Education (BzgA) could be a constructive way of reaching private animal keepers. Improved communication on the successes achieved with existing strategies to reduce the use of antibiotics  can promote the idea among animal keepers.

## 4.3. General public

Disseminating  information  to  the  general  public  about the treatment of infectious disease and appropriate use of antibiotics is to be improved. Ways in which these topics can be addressed include conducting media information campaigns,  developing educational content/materials and disseminating information through doctors in private practices.

Germany's comparatively high number of sepsis-related deaths are due in part to knowledge gaps among medical staff and the general public about the early symptoms of sepsis. This can result in late detection and treatment of a sepsis.  There  are  especially  large knowledge  gaps among people in general as regards infections and how sepsis  develops,  its  long-term  consequences  and  the importance of preventing infection by means of vaccinations and following basic hygiene rules.  For this reason, people's health literacy, skills and sepsis awareness must be improved.

Developing  communication  strategies  to  publish  the findings of surveillance and monitoring serves in providing informative scientific content for lay audiences and is directed at fostering better public awareness and understanding of such information.

## 4.4. Knowledge dissemination

Target  group-appropriate  dissemination  of  knowledge and information helps farmers, animal keepers, veterinarians,  people  working  in  the  food  processing industry,  consumers,  medical  staff  in  human  medicine, patients and their families to adopt the right behaviours in their respective environments and fields. When developing and providing modern, target groupappropriate informational material, allowance must also be made for changes in media use arising in the course of digitalisation. In addition to the target audience, people working  in  supervision,  media  representatives  and  the general public all benefit from targeted preparation and events-driven dissemination of information on the topics of antibiotics, AMR and hygiene.

When  disseminating  knowledge,  both  content  and  the chosen  channels  of  communication  must  focus  on  the target  group.  Special  needs  should  also  be  considered, such as when  addressing  risk groups, children and adolescents, and people who are visually impaired. One particularly  important  target  group  comprises  people who are socially disadvantaged and elderly people who live alone. Evidence-based, lay person-friendly tools for use in infectiological self-assessment (e.g. fact sheets and a  sepsis  checklist)  can  improve  people's  health  literacy concerning  infections  and  thus  result  by  way  of  selfempowerment  in early and adequate treatment of emergency cases of infectious disease (e.g. meningitis and sepsis).

A system of disseminators can be used to enable broadbased sharing of specialist and target group-appropriate information,  thereby  informing  those  affected  about changes in legal provisions as well as new requirements in a timely way.

Digital  solutions  can  support  the  appropriate  use  of antibiotics (see Action Area 3). Among other things, this involves providing user-friendly access to current guidelines, national resistance data, data on antibiotic use and  the  resulting  recommendations  for  calculated  and targeted  use  of  approved  antibiotics  via  a  dedicated, single-source website. Appropriate online services are to be further expanded at various levels.

When disseminating the results of resistance surveillance and  monitoring,  the  quantities  of  antibiotics  sold  and used in veterinary medicine, and the use of antibiotics in human medicine, new forms of communication such as dashboards  and  interactive  applications  are  also  to  be considered. Social media channels should also be used as a source of communication in order to reach the broadest possible audience.

## Action Area 5: European and international Cooperation

AMR is a multidimensional global challenge that does not stop  at  borders.  It  is  thus  one  which  the  international community must tackle together in a coordinated effort using the One Health approach. Global trade and travel result in a closely knit network encompassing all regions of  the  world.  Resistances that develop in one place can lead  to  the  global  spread  of  pathogens  that  no  longer respond to treatment. AMR poses a global health risk for humans and animals, and is a source of great pressure as regards  the  global  economy  and  the  security  of  food supply.

## 5.1. Cooperation to build capacity

Structurally weak regions are especially vulnerable to the risks of AMR  and  must  be  supported  through  the development  of  regulatory  and  monitoring  systems,  as well as improved national AMR prevention effort. Poverty also  promotes  the  emergence  and  spread  of  AMR.  In these  structurally  weak  countries  and  regions,  people living in poverty, marginalised groups, women  and children are all greatly at risk from AMR. These groups are at  risk  from  a  high  prevalence  of  infectious  disease, inadequate access to high-quality antibiotics and healthcare  facilities, and  a  lack  of clean  water  and sanitation.

In terms of population, the largest share of antibiotics is used in the global North, while the greatest exposure to disease  caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens occurs in the global South - especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The quadripartite organisations - the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Organization for Animal  Health  (WOAH),  the  UN  Food  and  Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the UN Development Programme (UNDP) - are key partners in the provision of support to other countries, and they collaborate closely as  part  of  the  One  Health  approach. In the form of the WHO  Collaborating  Centre  for  Antibiotic  Resistance, Consumption  and  Healthcare-Associated  Infections  at the RKI, a structure is in place which draws on operational experience  from  collaboration  in  this  particular  area  of AMR and is able to take on a coordinating role.

To contain the emergence and spread of AMR around the world, international coordination of targets and measures is needed. Strengthening healthcare systems (human and veterinary medicine) and preventing infection in humans, animals and plants are of key importance. The overarching  objective  of  all  associated  measures  is  to maintain the efficacy of antimicrobial substances, provide sustainable and equitable access to them to ensure their responsible and appropriate use in human and veterinary medicine, and in agriculture as a contribution to achieving the SDGs, and to prevent the emergence of infection by means of improved hygiene.

Priority areas of intervention and focus in the course of Germany's  international  cooperation  at  both  technical (including  by  higher  federal  authorities)  and  financial level are described below.

In the prevention of infectious disease, emphasis is placed on  improving  water  and  sanitation  (WASH)  as  well  as hygiene  and  infection  prevention  and  control  (IPC)  in hospitals and other medical facilities. Vaccination programmes for both humans and animals can also play an important role. In animal husbandry, access to animal healthcare services, optimisation of husbandry conditions and feeding, and also biosafety are further pillars in the prevention  of  infectious  disease.  These  are  the  most important instruments along with measures to underpin legal requirements and their enforcement.

To ensure the supply of essential medicines, investments must be made in building local capacities for vaccine and medicine production. It is thus important that environmental  legislation  be  strengthened  as  regards consideration of AMR aspects in order to avoid localised development  of resistance and its spread into the environment  at  production  sites  (e.g.  in  wastewater). With the help of social security systems, equitable access to healthcare facilities and medication is to be enabled, especially for women and children. Poor quality antimicrobial agents (counterfeit, wrongly labelled, expired  or  incorrectly  stored)  foster  the  emergence  of resistances and pose a risk to the provision of effective treatment.  This  is  why  it  is  necessary  to  implement

systems to promote the standards of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) in production along with monitoring  and  regulation  of  supply  chains  in  order  to detect, trace and eliminate the occurrence of poor quality or counterfeit antimicrobials. In many places, antibiotics and  other  antimicrobial  medicines  are  sold  over-thecounter.  Given  this  situation,  medical,  veterinary  and pharmaceutical staff must be trained in appropriate use and dispensing of antibiotics, and the legal prerequisites created for restrictive dispensing.

To enable diagnostic and sensitivity testing, the establishment and expansion of laboratories along with training of laboratory personnel  must  be  advanced, including  beyond  large  towns  and  cities.  Secure  supply chains for diagnostic materials must also be promoted to facilitate  local  production.  Data  collected  in  the  field provides  the  basis  for  appropriate  use  of  antimicrobial substances in patient care and for AMR surveillance and monitoring. Existing surveillance structures are often only of a temporary nature, financed using project funds and limited to larger conurbations in many cases. They thus provide an inadequate picture of the resistance situation and the AMR load. Data on resistance development and on the use and sale of antimicrobial agents could be used locally and regionally in treatment management and for global level reporting. New surveillance systems must be able to collect both nationwide and cross-sectoral data. In  line  with  the  One  Health  approach,  resistance  data from human medicine, veterinary medicine, the environmental  sector  and food  production  must  be integrated.  The  WHO  Tricycle  Protocol  and  Tripartite Integrated Surveillance System (TISSA) serve as examples.  Surveillance  and  monitoring  of  wastewater also harbours vast potential for the collection of resistance  data,  especially  in  regions  where  no  hospital laboratories exist.

At national level, coordinating structures that collate data on AMR and antibiotic use from various sectors, and then evaluate  and  forward  it  to  regional  and  global  systems (e.g. GLASS)  are vital. To  develop such structures, strengthening  public  health  institutes  and  veterinary services,  and  developing  a  digital  infrastructure  are  of huge importance.

## 5.2. Cooperation with organisations, committees and working groups

The work performed by international organisations, committees and platforms, including the definitions and standards they develop, is of key importance in combating AMR - also in Germany.

Over the past few years - among other things based on the  recommendations  of  the  Interagency  Coordination Group  (IACG)  issued  in  2019  -  a  range  of,  mostly intersectoral, international AMR structures and initiatives have been established and others are under development. There  are  also  various  working  groups  and  projects  in place at global level. Germany will continue its involvement and participation, and closely monitor international processes associated with AMR. This makes it possible to contribute German experience and standpoints,  learn  from  others  and  share  best-practice examples.

When  it  comes  to  global  trade in animals, animal products and also food and feed, international standards are of vast importance - especially those of the WOAH and  the  Codex  Alimentarius  Commission  (CAC),  a  joint instrument of the FAO and WHO. Through involvement in the quadripartite working groups and other international  organisations,  collaboration  with  the  EU partners pursues the goal of achieving a global ban on the use of antibiotics to improve production and as a routine prophylaxis  against  infection.  Also  together  with  its European partners, Germany seeks to have language to this effect agreed in G20 and G7 summit declarations and ministerial statements.

In recent years, Germany has worked to ensure that the G7  and  the  G20  address  AMR  as  a  priority  topic.  For example,  the  Global  AMR  Research  and  Development (R&amp;D) Hub was established following the G20 consultations under German presidency in 2017. The Hub is effectively a partnership of countries, nongovernmental donor organisations and intergovernmental  organisations.  It  serves  the  global coordination of research and development (R&amp;D) priorities, funding instruments and incentive mechanisms related to AMR.

Yet further commitments on combating AMR and sepsis were  secured  under  Germany's  G7  presidency  in  2022. These include the continuation of research and development  of  new,  urgently  needed  antibiotics  and improvements in the appropriate use of antibiotics and in the regulatory and economic conditions needed to secure the market for both existing and new antibiotics in the longer term. This calls, among other things, for national regulations  which  align  with  a  common  international framework.  The  Federal  Government  will  continue  to actively  advance  talks  in  the  respective  international forums, notably the G7 and G20.

Germany also continues to be involved in the various EUlevel working groups and projects around AMR. This gives

the  country's  experts  the  opportunity  to  participate  in overarching design of surveillance and monitoring systems,  and  in  the  analysis  and  interpretation of  data, address issues related to AMR, nosocomial infections and infections  that  develop  outside  the  healthcare  system, and benefit from related networks.

## Action Area 6: Research and Development

Research  and  innovation  can  contribute  significantly  to reducing  AMR.  This  makes  it  necessary  to  support  all relevant research areas in a One Health approach - from basic  research  to  clinical  research,  healthcare  research, research  on  public  health  issues,  environmental  and climate  research,  logistics  research,  and  collaborative research with the health and food sectors, agriculture, the building  and  construction  sector,  the  healthcare  sector and media and communications. In all phases of research and  development,  an  understanding  must  be  reached regarding  global  needs  and  actual  clinical  practice,  and these are to be given adequate consideration. Thus, in the course of associated projects, researchers, clinicians and stakeholders from practice are to be brought together via networks.

## 6.1. One Health research

One Health research aims to generate knowledge on the interdependence  of  human,  animal  and  environmental health, and use it to derive and test measures for use in prevention  and  intervention.  To  effectively  prevent  the spread  of  AMR,  the  underlying  mechanisms  must  be better  understood.  Among  other  things,  this  calls  for meaningful data and mathematical models which can be used to describe the emergence and spread of bacteria and  resistance-coding  genetic  elements.  To  create  the conditions needed in devising such models, a comprehensive data repository  must be made available in  each  sector.  In  addition,  molecular  mechanisms  and the risk factors for traditional transmission events, transmission frequencies, and the dynamics involved in the  spread  of  resistance  between  humans,  animals  and the  environment  must  all  be    understood.  Substantial findings are already available regarding the role played by the  water  cycle  in  the  release  and  spread  of  antibiotic residues,  resistant  bacteria  and  resistant  genes.  This  is where wastewater treatment plays a central role. Innovative  and  in  some  cases  decentralised  treatment methods  harbour  potential  for  the  control  of  critical releases  at  source.  The  importance  of  environmental factors such as biofilms and the impact of the potential release of antibiotics and resistant microorganisms into soil  via  wastewater  and  slurry  are  not  yet  adequately understood  and  -  along  with  measures  to  reduce  the

environmental  release  of  antibiotics  and  resistances  require further development and research.

The aim of  expanding One  Health research at national, European and international level is to address these and many other research questions. At national level, research on  open  questions  concerning  infection  epidemiology, molecular  mechanisms  of  infection  and  pathogenesis, and pathogen-host-environment interactions (among other things) is to be conducted at two newly-established institutes  -  the  Helmholtz  Institute  for  One  Health (HIOH) and the Institute of International Animal Health/One  Health  (IITG)  at  the Friedrich-LoefflerInstitute (FLI). The HIOH was founded in April 2022 by the  Helmholtz  Center  for  Infection  Research  (HZI)  in conjunction with the University of Greifswald, Greifswald University Medicine and the FLI as founding partners.

The HZI and the German Centre for Infection Research (DZIF), which is funded by the Federal Government and the respective host Länder, play a focal role as Germany's central  institutions  of  scientific  research  on  infection. They provide key substantive and structural impetus for further development  of the research area and for strengthening translational research.

Initial and further/continued training of a new generation of  infection  researchers also plays a vital role. Together with the host Länder, the  Federal Governmentsupports the  DZIF  with  the  DZIF  Academy,  a  comprehensive training and career development programme for students and graduates, and for scientists in clinical and translational research.

At international level, the European Partnership on One Health  AMR  enables  an  integrated  research  approach that covers the full pathogen spectrum, from bacteria to viruses, and  from  fungi to parasitic infections. The Partnership will build on existing initiatives  such as the Joint Programming Initiative on Antimicrobial Resistance (JPIAMR) and its mandate will be to assist and promote the European One Health Action Plan against Antimicrobial Resistance. In terms of content and focus, this  European  Partnership  aims  to  generate  knowledge

on AMR, develop new treatments, vaccines and diagnostics, and devise innovative economic models.

In  the  area  of  animal  health  at  international  level,  the European Partnership on Animal Health and Welfare will use both research and integrative activities to improve the status  of  knowledge  on  monitoring  and  intervention measures, diagnostics and alternatives treatment methods,  and  also  improve  animal  husbandry,  thereby supplementing and  enhancing knowledge generated by the European Partnership on One Health AMR.

## 6.2. New diagnostics

In order to slow down the  further spread of AMR new diagnostics  tools  are  urgently  needed  which  accelerate pathogen diagnostics. The prerequisite for targeted treatment  is  an  accurate  diagnosis  of  the  infectious pathogen  involved  and  its  behavioural  resistance.  In recent  years,  a  strong  upward  trend  has  been  seen  in point  of  care  testing  (POCT)  and  this  now  plays  an increasing role in outpatient care. Molecular  POCT processes bring significant time-saving benefits as there are  no  transport  times  involved.  They  are,  however, limited  to  predefined  purposes  and  known  resistances, and  cannot  replace  the  use  of  pathogen  cultures  for comprehensive pathogen characterisation. These approaches and the linking of POCT  and generic diagnostics  must  be  further  researched,  developed  and refined for use as coordinated diagnostic strategies, and then  marketed  and  ultimately  transferred  into  routine medical  care.  To  promote  the  development  of  new diagnostics procedures, licensing and approval processes and  also  reimbursement  models  can  provide  important development incentives.

For  initial  diagnosis,  rapid  and  easy-to-use  diagnostics tools (ideally at the point of care) are needed which are able  to  differentiate  between  a  bacterial  and  a  viral infection,  identify  the  pathogen  involved  and  indicate existing, molecular-detectable, treatment-relevant resistances.

## 6.3. New antibiotics, alternatives to antibiotic

## treatments and vaccines

One of the focal areas of future research at national and international level will involve the development of novel antibiotics, other antimicrobial medicines and antimicrobial processes which, for example, address the bacterial pathogens prioritised by the WHO and for which there is a particularly great medical need. The aim here will be to fill the pipeline with innovative drug candidates which  can  ideally  be  clinically  tested.  Development  of suitable  drug  candidates  in  late  pre-clinical  and  early clinical phases will also be promoted in a targeted effort

with the aim of subsequently finding an industry partner to develop them further. Collaboration between science and industry is to be sustained and expanded to strengthen  translation  and  introduce  new  drugs  into routine practice at a faster rate.

In  addition  to  national  funding  measures  for  research institutes and small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) in the medical biotechnology sectors, international initiatives  -  such  as  the  Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria  Biopharmaceutical  Accelerator  (CARB-X)  and the Global Antibiotic Research &amp; Development Partnership (GARDP) - are to be further pursued which drive  the  research  and  development  of  new  antibiotics and alternative medicines and treatments. Complementary to this process, the international CARBX and GARDP initiatives, which Germany also supports, serve  to  advance  the  development  of  new  antibiotics from early pre-clinical research through to clinical development, approval and provision.

Successful development of innovative treatments requires  scientific,  regulatory  and  economic  expertise. This is why both German approval authorities, the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) and the Paul-Ehrlich-Institute (PEI), assist the DZIF in clarifying issues of a regulatory and specialist/technical nature.

Development of natural substance-based antibiotics with innovative mechanisms of action is to be further intensified  and  the  pipeline  of  new  substances  is  to  be further expanded.

Development  of  alternative  and  immune-modulatory treatment  processes  (such  as  phages  and  non-coding RNAs) represents a key strategic approach in the treatment  of  bacterial  infections  and  sepsis.  In  basic research, a range of alternatives are already being explored,  although  their  clinical  efficacy  has  yet  to  be proven  in  many  cases.  Only  when  that  proof  has  been provided companies will be able to develop new products up  to  the  level  of  market  maturity.  In  the case  of promising  candidates,  their  clinical  efficacy  is  to  be proven  -  both  jointly  with  industrial  partners  and  with regulatory advice from the BfArM, thereby paving the way for their use in inpatient and outpatient care.

Measures such as the development of bacteriophages for use as alternative forms of treatment, in the decontamination of surfaces and germ reduction in food, and also in creating the regulatory conditions needed for their  future  use  are  of  interest  in  the  human  medicine, veterinary medicine, agriculture and food safety sectors. These measures involve the analysis of potential uses of

substances which, in addition to an antimicrobial effect, specifically address the underlying resistance mechanisms in AMR. Adopting this approach could foster the development  of  alternative treatment  processes which  make  the  range  of  established  antibiotics  usable again  in clinical practice. Also, in the  future, when developing  vaccines  against  multiresistant  pathogens, greater use is to be made of new technologies  such as messenger RNA (mRNA), protective microbiota components and viral vectors.

As an alternative to antibiotics, known medicines which are currently used for other indications, such as antibacterial active monoclonal antibodies or immunoglobulins,  can  also  be  used -especially in prevention.

Stool transplants and synthetic microbiomes also harbour potential. Innovation in this area rests on the concept of using natural resilience and microbiome resistance as a form  of  treatment  in  which  the  use  of  antibiotics  is reduced.

## 6.4. Prevention and public health

To  prevent  the  spread  of  resistances  it  is  important  to understand the underlying economic, social and behavioural  factors  involved.  For  example,  preventive design of workplaces  and  work  processes  must  be scientifically  monitored  and  evaluated  with  regard  to ways in which pathogens are spread. To ensure preventive measures are adhered to, improving people's health  literacy  and  skills  is  of  central  importance  (see Action  Area  4:  Communication  and  Cooperation).  This means, for example, developing and scientifically evaluating channels to access hard-to-reach groups.

To  secure  the  financial  feasibility of the  healthcare system, accompanying  health  economics  studies  on public health and hygiene measures to combat AMR play an important role.

## 6.5. Further research questions

To  track  the  use  of  antibiotics  at  the  various  levels  of outpatient care, identify influencing factors, and sustainably  implement  and  evaluate  measures  taken, point-of-care  research  is  needed  which  looks  at  the respective conditions in primary care, including in (residential)  care  facilities, specialist outpatient care and dental care, and enables targeted measures to be taken.

Further research and development is required on many issues  concerning  antibiotics  and  AMR  in  the  areas  of agriculture,  animal  husbandry,  veterinary  medicine  and food chain under the remit of BMEL that are mentioned

in other action areas. Animal vaccines can, for example, play a key role in preventing infection, while innovations in slaughtering and butchering processes can reduce both the release and the spread of resistance determinants via meat production and processing.

To foster practical use of new  knowledge and  findings, and  of  known  measures  which  are  effective  but  little used, targeted investigation is required as to the communication measures needed to facilitate and promote the transition from knowledge into practice.

## Conclusion

This AMR Strategy sets out the areas in which measures are  to  be  introduced  in  the  course  of  the  DART  2030 lifecycle  to  achieve  the  overarching goal of maintaining effective forms of treatment for bacterial infections. In a second step, those measures will be further defined and set  out  in  a  dedicated  action  plan.  They  are  then  to  be regularly reviewed, adapted and aligned as needed.

Combating AMR is a task in which everyone must play their part, from members of the general public to medical and  pharmaceutical  personnel  working  in  human  and veterinary medicine, from  the agricultural sector to stakeholders along the entire food value creation chain, from science and research to product development and the  legislator.  The  aim  of  DART  2030  is  to  collaborate with relevant stakeholders to  create the structures and conditions needed at local level to facilitate responsible use  of  antibiotics  and  effective  forms  of  treatment  for bacterial infections.

The key action areas set out in DART 2030 build on the findings achieved with its predecessor, DART 2020. They focus  on  improving  the  availability  of  data  through surveillance and monitoring, enhancing infection prevention,  promoting  appropriate  use  of  antibiotics, improving communication and collaboration at all levels, building  personnel  capacities,  developing  more  rapid diagnostic methods, innovative substances and treatment approaches,  and  conducting  research  into  vaccines  to prevent  infections  caused  by  resistant  pathogens.  Only through a combination of a range of measures and the willingness for collaboration at all decision-making levels and  across  all  disciplines  and  sectors,  can  long-term success  be  achieved.  Application  of  the  One  Health approach  at  all  times  is  of  central  importance.  Even though  all  of  the  action  areas  address  human  and veterinary  medicine,  agriculture  and  the  environment, different  approaches  and  their  resulting  measures  are nevertheless  needed  in  each  area  due  to  the  differing requirements that must be met, such as those at EU level.

The AMR burden is greater in resource-poor regions due to serious gaps in data on AMR, inadequate access to vital antibiotics, and poverty-driven interactions which further

promote  the  emergence  and  spread  of  AMR.  In  the coming years, therefore, the Federal Government will use a range  of strategies and  measures  to  address  the problem  of  increasing  AMR  at  many  different  levels  from regional to global - and take efforts to ensure that the issue remains on the global agenda.

## Executive Summary

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is increasing on a global scale and poses an ever-greater challenge when treating patients  in  human  and  veterinary  medicine.  Its  impact means  that  only  a  few  or  in  some  cases  no  treatment options are available in treating bacterial infections that were previously treated with ease.

Preventing the further spread of AMR calls for a package of measures which are to be implemented in a range of different areas. The Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance  adopted  by  the  World  Health  Assembly  in 2015  calls  upon  member  states  to  devise  their  own national action plans. Taking account of the goals set out in the Global Action Plan, these national action plans are to  contain  measures  which  are  aligned  to  the  actual situation in each country.

The first German  Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy (DART) was adopted by the Federal Government back in 2008 and its successor strategy, DART 2020, followed in 2015. The approaches and measures used must nonetheless be consistently further developed and aligned to changing conditions and needs. This is where DART 2030 comes in, the aim being to further address the outcomes of its predecessor strategy, DART 2020.

In DART 2030, the major focus areas of DART 2020 will be retained: expanding the surveillance and  monitoring systems on AMR and antibiotic use, improving infection prevention and promoting appropriate use of antibiotics, raising  public  awareness,  facilitating  the  acquisition  of necessary knowledge among medical professionals, and intensifying R&amp;D support - at all times taking account of the One Health approach to human, animal and environmental health. This report sets out the strategic goals and focuses in six action areas for combating AMR at both national level and through international collaboration  by  the  end  of  the  DART  2030  lifecycle. Specific measures will follow as part of a  future action plan to be published at a later date.

## 1. Prevention

This  action  area  takes  in  the  prevention  of  infectious diseases  requiring  treatment  using  infection  protection and  control  measures  (as  understood  in  their  broadest sense) to reduce  the use of antibiotics. Prevention includes,  for  example,  vaccinations  and  containing  the emergence and spread of AMR in and via the environment (e.g. through  wastewater,  waterbodies  and  soil),  and preventing the spread of AMR along the food chain.

## 2. Surveillance and Monitoring

Surveillance  and  monitoring  of  antibiotic  use  and  AMR are necessary to determine the situation in all healthcare sectors  in  both  human  and  veterinary  medicine,  detect changes, processes and trends, derive targeted measures and  measure  their  effects.  As  part  of  this  process,  the methods used, planning of targeted monitoring activities and both the evaluation and reporting of results are all subject to continuous development. The systems already in  place  are  to  be  continued,  further  developed  and enhanced. The long-term goal is to establish an integrated surveillance and monitoring system with data on  AMR  and  the  use  of  antibiotics in human  and veterinary  medicine  and  in  the  environment,  enabling that data to be analysed together.

- 3. Appropriate Use of Antibiotics including Laboratory Diagnostics

Antibiotic stewardship (ABS) is designed to ensure both indication-appropriate  use  of  antibiotics  and  the  best possible antibiotic treatment, and help reduce or prevent increasing  development  of  resistances.  ABS  takes  in reliable diagnostics, selection of a suitable antibiotic and its  fastest-possible use, as well as recommendations on treatment duration, antibiotic dosage, dosage form and reevaluation. The aim is to establish responsible use and handling of antibiotics by general practitioners, dentists and  veterinarians,  including  regular  reflection  on  their own  actions  and  behaviours,  and  make  these  standard practice.

## 4. Communication and Cooperation

Through the dissemination of corresponding knowledge, the aim is to raise public awareness to infections, the link between  non-targeted  antibiotic  treatment  and  AMR, and the relationship between infectious disease and the development of  sepsis as a  complication. It also  covers knowledge  dissemination  in  and  by  specialist  groups, including  in  medical  training  -  primarily  further  and continuing training. Added to this is exchange between stakeholders  in  all participating sectors and  interest groups.  In  addition  to  new  findings  from  research  and development, knowledge gaps and specific issues are also to be discussed to create incentives for collaborative and transnational research with a focus on practical application.

## 5. Cooperation in the EU and Beyond

AMR is a multidimensional global challenge that does not stop  at  borders.  It  is  thus  one  which  the  international community must tackle together in a coordinated effort using the One Health approach. Global trade and travel result in a closely knit network encompassing all regions of  the  world.  Resistances that develop in one place can

lead  to  the  global  spread  of  pathogens  that  no  longer respond to treatment. AMR poses a global health risk for humans and animals, and is a source of great pressure as regards  the  global  economy  and  the  security  of  food supply. To contain the emergence and spread of AMR on a  global  scale,  international  coordination of targets and measures is needed. Both cooperation in capacity building efforts and also collaboration with international organisations, committees and working groups are to be intensified and supported.

## 6. Research and Development

Research  and  innovation  can  contribute  significantly  in reducing  AMR.  This  makes  it  necessary  to  support  all relevant research areas in a One Health approach - from basic  research  to  clinical  research,  healthcare  research, research  on  public  health  issues,  environmental  and climate research, logistics research, collaborative research with the health, food, agriculture, building and construction, and healthcare sectors, as well as media and communications. In all research and development phases,  knowledge  and  understanding  of  global  needs and actual clinical practice are to be generated and taken into account.
