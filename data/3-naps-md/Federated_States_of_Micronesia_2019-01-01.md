Using antimicrobials saves life. The infections that cause serious illnesses can be averted through   the use of antimicrobials.  However, when these antimicrobials are not  used properly, their potency to fight off infections can be weakened.

The  threat of the power of our antibiotics   through   increasing   antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is worrisome. FSM is   seeing   increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance;   including  multi-drug resistant   tuberculosis   (TB) When AMR is found, treatment can be   prolonged and becomes 5 to 10 times more expensive. In some may be no drugs   available to treat   infections. Without concerted efforts and action to ensure proper use of antimicrobials; AMR will increase throughout our young nation. losing

1 wholeheartedly endorse the actions stated in this National Multisectoral Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance for the Federated States of Micronesia; a collaboration between and among the relevant agencies of the FSM and State government agencies; partners; and NGOs. A One-Health approach is needed to tackle the issues of overuse and misuse of antimicrobials in human and animal health and to prevent antimicrobial residues in the environment.

1 congratulate everyone who has contributed their time and resources into the development of this AMR Multisectoral Action Plan: In the 1 also urge everyone to give high priority in implementing the actions in this Plan. Together, we can make a difference for our people.

## Joint Foreword by Department of Health &amp; Social Affairs and Department of Resources &amp; Development

Antimicrobial  Resistance (AMR) occurs when micro-organisms develop the ability to survive exposure to antimicrobials. When this happens; the or medicine is no longer effective: drug

AMR is a serious and growing public health problem worldwide and the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is also experiencing this problem. Available data show a steady rise in AMR with 30-70% of some types of bacteria demonstrating resistance to commonly used antibiotics. We need to be vigilant and increase awareness amongst our people and communities on the danger this problem can have.

This National Multisectoral Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance for the Federated States of Micronesia was developed to address the growing threat of the development of AMR by an ever-increasing range of bacteria; parasites; viruses and fungi in all the four states of FSM. It represents the collective and expert views of stakeholders from the four states including private sectors and civil societies. The plan is also aligned to the WHO global action and regional action agenda on AMR.

We are confident that this Multisectoral  action plan will help deliver an effective and sustainable response to antimicrobial resistance in FSM.  We encourage all stakeholders to workltogether and support the implementation of this plan that will ultimately protect our future generations.

## 1.0 Introduction

In  2014,  the  World  Health  Organisation  (WHO)  declared  antimicrobial  resistance  as  a global health threat that requires urgent collaborative action. High rates of resistance to hospital  and  community-acquired infections have been reported globally, with some of the highest rates reported in the Western Pacific Region.

Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) has become one of the biggest threats to global health and affects both human and animal health. The World Health Assembly in 2015 endorsed the Global  Action  Plan  on  Antimicrobial  Resistance 1 that  urges  Member  States  to develop national AMR plans by May 2017.

The commitment from member states to develop their national action on AMR has been overwhelming.  In  the  Federated  States  of  Micronesia,  many  common  infections  are becoming resistant to  antibiotics  and  few  alternative  treatments  will  be  available  soon. Hence, FSM has identified AMR as an important and priority health agenda that needs to be addressed by all states.   Three multi-stakeholder meetings were convened to discuss and develop this National Multisectoral Action Plan on AMR with integrated activities to combat AMR in the FSM.

This National Multisectoral Plan on AMR is aligned to the priority actions listed in the Action  Agenda  for  Antimicrobial  Resistance  in  the  Western  Pacific  Region   and  the 2 Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance that focuses on  four main principles of the global action plan; 1) whole-of-society engagement, 2) prevention first, 3) access to effective treatment, and 4) sustainability.

## 2.0 Summary of brief Situational Analysis on

## Antimicrobial Resistance in FSM

The FSM Department of Health and Social Affairs regularly published the leading causes for  hospitalizations  and  out-patient  visits  to  health  services.  While  hypertension  and diabetes are major causes of morbidity, illness caused by infectious agents outnumbers those caused by hypertension and diabetes combined.

Infections of the upper respiratory tract, urinary tract, gastro-intestine and ear infections account  for  a  high  burden  of  disease  in  FSM.  There  is  a  relatively  high  incidence  of tuberculosis (TB) and sexually transmitted infections caused by chlamydia and to a lesser extent gonorrhoea.

FSM laboratories have published summary reports of antibiotic resistance patterns from the  bacteria  isolated  from  clinical  specimens.  While  the  laboratories  do  not  have  the capacity  to  test  for  all  antimicrobials  and  all  infectious  agents;  the  laboratory  reports clearly  show  an  increasing  amount  of  antimicrobial  resistance.  Methicillin  resistant  S. aureus  is  commonly  isolated  from  both  in  patients  and  outpatients.  There  is  a  high proportion  of  enteric  bacteria  isolated  that  demonstrate  resistance  to  a  number  of commonly  used  antibiotics.  In  some  cases,  resistance  has  been  noted  to  all  first  and second line antibiotics.

Additionally, FSM has experienced two outbreaks of multi-drug resistant TB in 2007 and 2009.  These  laboratory  reports  confirm  the  serious  situation  of  antibiotic  resistance  in FSM that needs to be addressed urgently.

Unfortunately, the impact of AMR in the FSM has not been fully established, especially in  the  animal  health  sector,  and  the  country  self-assessment,  which  was  completed  in May  2017,  reveals  that  important  improvements  were  made  in  many  areas,  but  some weaknesses still remain. The results of the survey highlighted the need to have:

- a) a  national  comprehensive  AMR  plan  with  a  formed  committee,  clear  reporting structure between national and state level and champions to drive the country's AMR agenda;
- b) a dedicated budget to support the implementation of the AMR plan in all states;
- c) national laboratory surveillance to track AMR in humans and animals in all states;
- d) specific regulation to regulate, enforce and promote the rational use of antimicrobials in both human and animal health;
- e) an antimicrobial stewardship programme mainly in state hospitals;
- f) effective  procurement  and  supply  chain  management  in  order  to  ensure  the availability and accessibility of quality antimicrobials;
- g) infection prevention and  control activities and  programmes  in  all sectors, including food safety;
- h) a well-trained workforce on how to combat AMR;
- i) continuous  awareness  campaign  on  AMR  targeted  at  the  public  and  health professionals, including vaccinations; and

- j) proper waste management of antimicrobials.

In summary, brief country situation analysis has identified areas that need strengthening such as:

- 1) Awareness raising on AMR in all areas;
- 2) Formulation of national comprehensive plan on antimicrobial resistance;
- 3) Coordinated national surveillance systems to monitor AMR  and antimicrobial use in all states; and
- 4) Organized regulatory framework and governance to implement the AMR plan.

## 3.0 Governance of Antimicrobial Resistance in FSM

- i. High level endorsement of NAP and relevant policies and legislation
- ii. National AMR Committee (newly formed) shall provide briefings and updates to President  and  Congress  on  progress  of  AMR  NAP  implementation  in  all  FSM states  with  further  recommendations  for  consideration  and  endorsement.  Act  as advisor  to  the  President  from  time  to  time.  Provide  technical  guidance  to  state AMR  committees  as  when  required  in  relation  to  the  implementation  of  state AMR  plan.  Direct/guide  FSM  response  (planning)  to  AMR  related  activities. Coordinate  external  assistance  and  funding  to  support  the  implementation  of AMR activities in each state. FSM National AMR committee will be co - chaired by FSM Department of Health and Social Affairs and the Department of Resource and  Development.  Chairmanship  will  be  rotated  between  the  two  co-chairing departments.
- iii. State AMR Committee shall coordinate, implement and monitor state AMR plan and provide reports/feedback to National AMR committee and State Governors, when needed.
