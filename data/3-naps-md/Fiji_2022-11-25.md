## Foreword

Anti-microbial Resistance (AMR) is real. It threatens the very core of modern medicine and adversely affect our responses against infections, in both preventative and clinical services settings. Our government is committed to adopting the One Health Approach against AMR now and onwards to 2030.    This is more critical than ever with the global fight against COVID and other emerging diseases.

Misuse  of  antibiotics  is  among  the  main drivers  underpinning  the  development of AMR. Resistance to last-line antibiotics also compromises the effectiveness of life saving medical  interventions  such  as  intensive  care, cancer  treatment  and  organ transplantation.   This  plan  is  aligned  to  global,  regional  and  national  priorities  and cultural  factors  that  will  help  shape  'wise'  antimicrobials  use,  the  emergence,  and transmission  of  resistance  and  how  to  combat  AMR.  If  we  do  not  practice  good antimicrobial stewardship, we and future generations will not experience the positive outcomes of these medicines that our parents experienced, but succumb to simple infections unlike before the pre-antibiotic era.

The 74 th  World Health Assembly (WHA) held in June 2021, reinforces three continuing commitments  to  tackle  this  'silent  tsunami'  AMR  in  low -and  middle-income countries: (1) urgent need for better vaccines access; (2) more funding committed and (3)  a  new  global  legal  framework.  The  May  2015  WHA  adopted  the  Quadripartite Global Action Plan (GAP) for us all to collaborate by sharing resources and information to align and harmonize our fight against this global health threat under  these five strategic objectives:

- 1. To improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance through effective communication, education and training;
- 2. To  strengthen  the  knowledge  and  evidence  base  through  surveillance  and research;
- 3. To reduce the incidence of infection through effective sanitation, hygiene and infection prevention measures;
- 4. To optimize the use of antimicrobial medicines in human and animal health, and;
- 5. To develop the economic case for sustainable investment, takes into account our context.

Additionally, the Framework for Accelerating Action to Fight Antimicrobial Resistance in the Western Pacific Region provides guidance towards this review: (i) to strengthen systems as foundation for sustainable actions; (ii) to work beyond health; (iii) to take actions today, guided by their vision of the future; and (iv) to build solutions from the ground up, while ensuring country impact.

With One Health Approach to combat AMR, our partners in government, academia, development  partners  and  civil  society  organisations;  we  will  stay  true  to  our commitment to safeguard against environmental threats and public health

emergencies and  ensuring better collaboration key health-related and SDG issues such as climate crisis and AMR. The development of this new action plan was highly consultative, participatory and transparent

Apart from climate change and NCDs; AMR is a real threat to our island home. We must work as one and be the stewards of the future. We remain committed and wish us all every success in implementing the activities of the Plan.

Together we can. Together we will. Together we must.

## Glossary

Antimicrobials -  include  antibiotics,  antivirals,  antifungals  and  antiprotozoals.  They are active substances of synthetic or natural origin which kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms. Used in every-day medicine (e.g., urinary tract infections, surgery and care  of  premature  babies),  they  are  vital  to  preventing  and  treating  infections  in humans and animals)

Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) - is the ability of microorganisms, such as bacteria, to become increasingly resistant to an antimicrobial to which they were previously susceptible. AMR is a consequence of natural selection and genetic mutation. Such mutation is then passed on conferring resistance. This natural selection process is exacerbated by human factors such as inappropriate use of antimicrobials in human and veterinary medicine, poor hygiene conditions and practices in healthcare settings or in the food chain facilitating the transmission of resistant microorganisms. Over time, this makes antimicrobials less effective and ultimately useless.

One Health is a term used to describe a principle which recognises that human and animal  health  are  interconnected,  that  diseases  are  transmitted  from  humans  to animals  and  vice  versa  and  must  therefore  be  tackled  in  both.  The  One  Health approach  also  encompasses  the  environment,  another  link  between  humans  and animals and likewise a potential source of new resistant microorganisms. This term is  globally  recognised,  having  been  widely  used  and  in  the  2016  United  Nations Political Declaration on Antimicrobial Resistance.

## 1. Introduction

The Republic of Fiji, one of the largest economies of the South Pacific region, has a relatively high level of human development index (HDI) of 0.743.  Its multi-ethnic population, which is estimated at approximately 850 thousand, is growing slowly due to a moderately low level of fertility and a high level of emigration. 1  The adult literacy rate in Fiji was estimated at around 91.6 percent. Primary and secondary school education is free and compulsory for all Fijians.

Fiji's economy is largely agricultural, main export commodities are sugarcane, fruits such as papaya and root crops such as taro and kava. 2  Subsistence farmers earn supplementary cash  income.  Remittances    is  an  upcoming  major  source  of  foreign  exchange.  Fiji  is classified  as  an  Upper  Middle-Income  country  (UMIC) by the World Bank in 2019. Fiji's economy is slowly on its way to recovery post-COVID.

Life  expectancy  was  68  years  in  2020. 3   Tuberculosis  is  widely  prevalent    and  other common diseases include Hepatitis A and typhoid. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are high in the country. Key non-communicable diseases are diabetes and coronary health diseases followed by stroke. Anecdotal reports state high diabetic  infections  are  poorly managed in communities and can be a major 'AMR incubator.'

In 2021, Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and International Health Regulations (IHR) Core Capacity indices  were rated at  98 and 61 percent 4  respectively. However, effective HIV and TB treatment coverage were both low at  40 percent and 64.8 percent.  Strong immunization cover was greater than 99 percent for all under 5  vaccines. More than 68 and 99 percent of our  people  access  piped  water  and  basic  sanitation  services.  Fiji  has  low  out-of-pocket spending, suggesting a low risk of financial hardships. 5

The Fijian Government is congratulated, having continually stepped up since 2015 - making AMR  a  high  priority  health  agenda.  The  Constitution  2013  under  Article  38;  declares  a person's right to health and within the Government's resources to ensure good wealth and well-being.  The  National  Development  Plan  (NDP)  5/20  has  a  two-prong  approach  of 'Inclusive  Socio economic  Development'  and  'Transformational  Strategic  Thrusts'    to -support the Human Health Sector strategic intent.

All Quadripartite Partner line ministries have a common pledge as 'stewards of the future 6 to mitigate risks such as climate crisis, AMR  and emerging diseases that can affect our population, economic development and environment. Animal Health (AH) sector focuses on three (3) Strategic Priorities, M&amp;E framework that links up and measures commitments to improve food security through teaching farmers to adopt safe plant-based and livestock food production practices; strengthen legislative/regulatory and  policy frameworks. Environment Health (EH) focus on strengthening sectoral policies, legislations and better waterways/environment management.

Human Health (HH) sector's strategic intent to 2025 strongly resonates with WHO and NDP commitments under Strategic Priorities 1 and 3; to Safeguard against environmental threats and public health emergencies and 'ensuring better collaboration with other government departments on key healthrelated and SDG issues such as climate crisis and AMR.' MHMS has pledged to strengthen systems that can prevent, detect,  respond and monitor public health  emergencies.    The  National  AMR  Committee  (NARC)  is  recognised  in  using  an 'interagency approach to combat AMR' a One Health Approach.

Border Control The Biosecurity Authority of Fiji (BAF) and Fiji Revenue Customs Services (FRCS) are core One Health partners.  BAF is the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) national focal point on veterinary products.  Their roles have not been maximised by  NARC  due  to  lack  of  legislation  framework.    New  regulations  to  the  Fiji  Medicinal Products  Act  2011  are  critical  to  fully  mandate  their  border  and  in-country  functions  to prohibit importation, use and eradicate harmful products that contribute to the AMR burden.

Developments  partners  (DP),  Civil  Society  Organisations  (CSO),  Academia,  whole  of government and community support is vital. Transformational multisectoral support can facilitate  progress  towards  meeting  the  AMR  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs) sensitive indicators. 7

Tripartite AMR Country Self-assessment Survey (TrACSS) -  NARC has good leadership and governance.  NARC has six technical working groups (TWGs) structures with draft Terms of References (ToR) and will be gazetted shortly. Some progress seen in improving the 2014 TrACSS major gaps and challenges. 8  In summary, the draft 2022 TrACSS has highlighted  1) the need to fully adopt and continue to strengthen One Health Approach partnership 2) lack of legislations against use of medicated feed and antibiotics as growth promoters and to fully mandate the One Health Approach 3) continue to improve  community awareness  and professional  AMR  education  in  all  sectors;  4)  Lacks  a  national  integrated  surveillance system; no  national mycology reference laboratory and lack of strategic AMR intelligence

for informed decision making and responsive policy formulations; 5) need to formalise good Infection  Control  Prevention  Care  in  all  sectors;  6)  COVID-19  and  lack  of  dedicated government funding had overall negative impacts; and 7); lacks  national monitoring system to track NAP implementation and quality improvement programs.

## 2. A pragmatic and doable National Action Plan

The WHO's Strategic and Technical Advisory Group on AMR (STAG -AMR) emphasises the need for member states to prioritise the human health agenda.  Stepping up leadership, governance and investments on AMR and learning from other public health agendas can identify tailored potential solutions. Knowing our AMR burden by investing in strategic AMR intelligence through research, surveys and routine surveillance in this NAP lifetime.

This NAP is aligned to the WHO GAP 2015 five Strategic Objectives (SO). The post-Covid 2022 WHO Strategic Priorities (SPs) on AMR 9   is used as reference to strategically prioritise NAP activities during this last decade of action.   NARC commits to adopting the One Health Approach to implement NAP. NARC has prioritised cost effective and impactful mutually agreed activities in the workplan that will contribute towards reducing the AMR burden in Fiji, as in Figure 1.

## 3.  The Need for our Action Against AMR - One Health Approach

State of Play: Penicillin was first discovered in 1928. These life-saving antimicrobials (AMs) have revolutionised our societies. Fast forward to this era, the risk of AMR has intensified, the  main  driver  is  abuse  and  misuse  of  AMs.    Fiji  is  not  spared  from  the  increasing emergence and spread of multi-resistant organisms. We must act now to reverse current AMR trends. If not,  we  could  face  a  return  to  the  pre-antibiotic  era;  simple  wounds  and infections causing significant harm and  morbid outcomes.

The World Bank 6  has warned that, by 2050, drug-resistant infections could cause global economic  damage  on  a  par  with  the  2008  financial  crisis.  AMR  also  threatens  the

achievement of several of the United Nations' SDGs,  in particular SDG3 -  for good health and well-being. 7

Why do we need the One Health Approach to combat AMR:

- ❖ We share the same environment with animals.
- ❖ We are exposed to the same general families of bacteria and other microbes.
- ❖ We are treated with the same group of antimicrobials, and;
- ❖ Microbes can pass from animals to humans and vice versa with the environment acting as a potential reservoir of resistant organisms, as in figure 2.

Global: The recent Lancet Publication 10  estimated that in 2019, about 4.95 million deaths were associated with AMR, of which, 1.27 million deaths attributed to bacterial AMR. About 1.25 million people died from lower respiratory infections -making it the most challenging infection. Majority of AMR associated deaths occurred in the Western African sub-Sahara region and the lowest in Australasia.

The top six pathogens for deaths associated with resistance are ( Escherichia coli , followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa )  were responsible for about 20% deaths attributable to AMR and 3·57 million deaths associated with AMR in 2019.

One pathogen -drug combination, methicillin-resistant S aureus, caused more than 100 000 deaths attributable to AMR in 2019, multidrug-resistant excluding extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E coli, carbapenem-resistant A baumannii, fluoroquinolone-resistant E coli, carbapenem resistant K pneumoniae, and thirdgeneration cephalosporin-resistant K pneumoniae.

(Adapted from -European One Health Initiative Plan Against AMR 2017)

Blue Pacific : Recent analysis publication 11  showed a wide range of WHO priority pathogens existed  in  the    Pacific  Island  Country  and  Territories(PICTs ,  with ) E.coli-3rd  generation cephalosporin resistance proportions from 12% in Fiji, 0% in Kiribati, 24% in PNG and 77% in Federated States of Micronesia - well below other AMR 'hot spots' like China (20% -95%) and India (66%). Resistance to key antibiotics like Carbapenem remains low despite multiple reported  outbreaks;  however,  1%  of K  pneumoniae isolates  surveillance  reported  from  a Fijian tertiary hospital. These indicates urgent need to invest in improving AMR intelligence;

strengthening laboratory surveillance systems; Infection Prevention Control and Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs.

Moreover,  a  latest  report  showed  high  incidences.      of  community  acquired  MethicillinResistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) infections in Pacific Island Countries and Territories. 12  The Kingdom of Tonga reported a high MRSA rate of 42% in 2016, that prompted routine laboratory-based surveillance; 60% of MRSA cases were diabetics from 40 to 60 years of age due to poorly managed diabeticinfections  in  community  settings.  A  Nauru  costing  study  estimated  economic  costs  to Salmonella Typhi outbreak  in restaurants was at USD46, 000 -critical  to  improve  food hygienic and safety handling practices.

Our Island Home: A Carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CR-Ab) research 13 at an adult Intensive Care Unit (ICU) attributed these issues as possible causes for the CR-Ab Outbreak:

- ❖ long hospital ICU stay (median/maximum at 26/31 days);
- ❖ poor IPC practices and both first-line antibiotics and IPC products supply instability;
- ❖ inappropriate use of restricted antibiotics such as meropenem was at 47%; and,
- ❖ high risk of person-to-person transmissions via contaminated hands or surfaces.

The majority (24/35, 69%) were isolated from invasive samples, including indwelling tips and  blood  culture,  and  31%  were  from  non-invasive  samples  associated  with  urinary, respiratory, and surgical site infections.  Sources of strain may be linked to international travel  from  India  and  Australia.  The  research  report  strongly  echoed  the  last  ICU  2017 recommendations of: 1)  improving cleaning of patient care environment and equipment, avoiding reuse of single-use, disposable equipment and ensuring effective sterilisation of items; 2) improving IPC practices, including appropriate hand hygiene, transmission-based precautions  (especially  contact  precautions),  use  of  sterile  medications/solutions  for injections;    3)  to  the  future,  incorporate  molecular  diagnostic  and  surveillance  capacity frameworks to improve response to disease outbreaks in Fiji.

The WHO Survey of the Progress of Implementation of NAP in the Pacific Report 2020 urgently  calls  on  Fiji  MHMS  and  NARC  to  improve  governance  structures  and  update legislations  enabling  One  Health  Approach;    strengthen  and  integrate  laboratory  and surveillance  capacities;  reposition  Fiji  CDC  as  National  Reference  Laboratory  in  human health;  improve supply stability of antimicrobials and laboratory diagnostics; partner with other  PICTs/Secretariat  of  the  Pacific  Community  (SPC)  to  develop  formal  training  in surveillance, AMS, IPC and One Health; encourage culture of research in all sectors including KAP survey, Operational Research to improve One Health against AMR interventions, update necessary AMS flagship documents; credible AMR intelligence to craft market-segmented

community  health  education  programs  on  AMR  linked  to  other  public  health  programs; adopt AMC/WPCRASS by 2025 and work with academia to improve pharmaceutical and animal waste management.

The University of the South Pacific (USP) conducted research on pharmaceutical waste management in selected coastal sites on Viti Levu.  Findings revealed 80 pharmaceuticals were found. Literature stated, that main sources were  via sewage plants, primary, secondary and tertiary levels, USP will need to trace back to presumed sources. Agriculture sources have  been  suggested  via  use  of  antibiotics  in  livestock  (animal  waste)  and  disposal  of expired pharmaceuticals.

Consistent  presence  of  Sulphamethoxazole  (in  Septrin®/Bactrim®),  Trimethoprim  and antidepressants. Impact of these pharmaceuticals are detrimental to marine life due to its long presence. Communities are strongly advised to clean and cook marine life well in these surveyed sites such as Votua, Laucala Bay and Leleuvia Island.

Project Reviews: Resonates with WHO 2020 review. The  October 2021 Mid-term Review of the multi-partnership (One Health Approach) Enhancing the Management of AMR (EMAR) in Fiji, recommends to: develop and test cost-effective methods to achieve integrated public health surveillance networks for AMR; develop a strategy for qualitative data collection to be  included  in  the  Knowledge  Attitudes  Perceptions  (KAP)  analysis  -  ensure  alignment, where  possible,  of  the  structured  KAP  surveys  across  the  human  and  animal  health components; Include thinking on broader integrated (LIMS) and associated sustainability of laboratory capacity building; improve communications with one vision and one purpose with Quadripartite  partners  and  associates;  ensure  the  design  of  communication,  policy  and outreach  materials  are  informed  by  the  project  activities  to  be  'fit  for  purpose'  for  the intended audience; integrated One Health approaches to AMR surveillance and management in the Pacific; Project may extend to 2027. Include feasible recommendations and transitioning details into the new NAP for continuity.

Discussions on AMU guideline during the Fiji  Visit  to  align  to  local  context  and  process  of  endorsement,  Discussions  on  training opportunities with SPC. EH : Very little data and One Health and explore opportunities to work together; possible priority clean water and waste management. HH: Wins in IPC, vaccines uptake  and  surveillance  as  Fiji  continues  to  strengthen    its  fight  to  contain  COVID-19. Continued  sessions  of  the  AMS  modules -Part  1  completed  and  Part  2  to  commence discussions  on  monitoring  and  reporting  systems.  Advice  and  technical  guidance  for COVID-19  laboratory  testing,  closely  collaborating  with  Colonial  War  Memorial  Hospital micro laboratory to support review and update of SoPs and foster greater clinical liaison between laboratory, AMS and IPC.

Recent developments and way forward : On May 28 th  2022, the 75th World Health Assembly approved a 'Global Strategy on Infection Prevention and Control (IPC)' through a resolution that aims to position IPC as central to infectious hazard and health emergency preparedness  and  response. 14       It  is  key  to  addressing  the  silent  burden  of  healthcare associated infections (HAIs) and AMR.

Strengthen IPC in both community and health systems and high-quality patient-centred care delivery, with the aim of improving patient and health worker safety. This resonates well with the recent launch of the  National Infection Prevention Control Guidelines for HH use in all public  health  facilities.  MHMS  will  continue  to  improve  timely  supply  stability  of  IPC commodities. Strengthening good compliance to personal and workplace IPC care was a BIG WIN during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Fiji will position IPC as central as a cost-effective and high impact activity in reducing the burden of AMR -integrated with  the other four GAP strategic objectives.

Antimicrobial Consumption (AMC) data call from public health hospitals via AMC/WPCRASS will commence in 2023. This will  extend  as a  pilot call in selected private locally pre-qualified wholesalers/importers in 2024.

AMR is a good example of a One Health approach in which human health is connected to that of animals, and the environment. Only a multidisciplinary effort can provide an adequate response.  The  April  2022  UNEP  publication  Environmental  Dimensions  of  Antimicrobial Resistance emphasises the need on strengthening the Quadripartite partnerships.

Climate crisis with ever increasing temperature and severe natural disasters fuels climatesensitive infections such as dengue, leptospirosis, typhoid, diarrhoea, respiratory  and skin infections  that  may  be  resistant  to  first  line  antimicrobials.  Waste  and  clean  water management is critical especially with chemicals such as pesticides from farms; animal and industrial waste; household waste and proper disposal of expired pharmaceuticals that will contaminate our waterways and marine life.

Prepositioning  Fiji  to  be  successful  mandates.  the  adoption  of  One  Health  Approach  to secure good governance and technically sound investment cases that are  integrated 'best -buys' resulting in high -impact positive health outcomes.

The decisions we make today will make us have a brighter future.  We have the power to change big things. We can have big wins against AMR.

## 4. One Health Approach - Reviewing and Updating the Plan

The Consultant presented to the six NARC technical working groups (TWGs) and the NARC plus key informant interviews (KIIs) in May 2022. A situation analysis was developed from review of both published and unpublished data, surveys and analysis of KII results. To seek validation,  a  twoday One Health stakeholders' consultation workshop was conducted in early  June  2022.  The  workshop  enabled  the  development  of  mutually  agreed  strategic intent, objectives, priority, pragmatic and realistic activities for the workplan greatly assisted to craft the updated NAP, Figure 3.

The One Health NAP against AMR will be vetted by NARC before endorsements by MHMS Executives and Cabinet with accompanying Policy Paper. Cabinet endorsement allows for both governance and sustainability.

## 5. Summary of brief Situational Analysis on AMR in Fiji

Collated  information  was  analysed  and  synthesised  aligned  to  the  five  GAP  strategic objectives and  four WHO Strategic Priorities. These were further simplified to ten (10) focus areas (FA) to plot the current status of AMR in Fiji, graphicFigure 4 and narrative format.

The NARC Secretariat can use the radar chart as a tool to monitor progress.  The Fijian Government encourages all ministries to reach at least 60% success in all projects, in this context  our  ten  focus  areas.  NARC  will  continue  to  strengthen  these  FAs  over  the  NAP lifetime.

The current situation shows five (of ten) focus areas scoring at most 50%.  Linked activities in the new NAP will be prioritised to be implemented first. Strengthening legislations and systems coupled with strong advocacy measures to drive the other five focus areas towards at least 80% grading in 2025.  Fiji will adopt the One Health Approach to combat AMR during last decade of action.

FIGURE 4 -RADAR CHART FOR CURRENT AMR STATUS IN FIJI

<!-- image -->

Focus  Area  1 -Leadership  &amp;  Governance:  Stepping  up  the  Leadership  for  our  AMR Response : At 80% grading, The NARC is recognised under the Fiji Medicinal Products Act 2011, section 24 (1 to 7). NARC is required to finalise its governance structures, strategic and operational systems. NARC will strengthen its Quadripartite partnership using the One

Health Approach with One Vision; Aligning purpose of the five-line ministries  and strengthen collaboration and engagement on Policies, Legislations and Regulations including Border Control. NARC is well functioning with soon to be gazetted six (6) Technical Working Groups (TWG).  Update  TWG  terms  of  references  (ToR).  MHMS  supports  a  National  AMR Coordinator  who  provides  secretariat  support  to  NARC  under  the  Essential  Medicines Authority  Team.      NARC  is  required  to  update  its  ToR  to  reflect  One  Health  Approach, governance and reporting requirements.

NARC will take lead to update and align legislations, craft Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) between all One Health participating line ministries and with Biosecurity Authority of Fiji  (BAF)  and  Fiji  Revenue  Customs  Services  (FRCS).  This  will  assist  in  importation (especially  falsified  AMs,  animal  feeds  and  growth  promoters),  control,  licensing  and investigations  by  2024.  Appropriate  entry  points  for  One  Health  against  AMR  will  be identified, in order to establish technical, digital and information sharing alliance through these MoUs.

Focus Area 2 - National AMR action plan 2015-2018: At 80% grading Current NAP was the , first to be developed in the WHO Western Pacific Region and was endorsed in late 2015. NAP Annual Operational Plan was developed in 2016.  NAP was aligned to GAP and WPRO Framework on Accelerated Action against AMR. Only 10% of activities fully implemented, 50% in progress, 40% did not commence at all. Plausible explanations were due to lack of funding and COVID19 public health restrictions that were beyond NARC's control. There was no formal request to extend use of the 2015 NAP edition.  NARC neither developed accompanying NAP Costing nor M&amp;E frameworks.

Development  Partners  (DP)  continued  support  for  WHO-World  Antimicrobial  Awareness Week (WAAW), Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) supported Combat-AMR and  EMAR  to  progress  SO1,  SO2  and  SO  3.  NARC  will  advocate  and  submit  budget  to Ministry of Economy and DPs funding for each fiscal year and Aid in Kind needs.

Focus Area 3 - Awareness Campaigns: Public &amp; training for professionals: At 50% and is a Priority people-centric focus area for Fiji. There is no National Strategic Health Communication and Community Engagement Plan for AMR .  Neither integration with other public health programs nor AH/EH programs conducted. Ad hoc activities with a flurry of community  health  education  activities  during  World  Antibiotic  Awareness  Week  in November each year. AH sector animal husbandry team benefitted from EMAR project and conducted  some  health  education  activities  to  selected  farmers.  Need  to  strengthen integrated  planning  and  co-sharing  support  to  improve  awareness  and  proficiency  on antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes and propose to mandate under Principal Act and Regulations, if not reflected.

Critical  to  link  with  AH  and  EH -zoonotic-Communicable  Diseases  (CDs)  and  climate sensitive infections with NCDs: Dengue, Leptospirosis, Typhoid, COVID-19, Monkeypox etc. Ensure good aseptic, IPC etiquette - personal, home, schools and workplace settings linked to Vaccination and Wellness Programs.

Education and training strategies for professionals: COMBAT-AMR Project enabled AMS trainings focussed on Antimicrobial Standard Treatment Guidelines (STGs) with 529 HH workers trained (Face to face/online) for maritime zone.

A  One  Health  national  workshop  was  conducted  in  2019.  EMAR  -  Training  was  also conducted.  Critical  to  involve  staff  from  the  other  five  participating  line  ministries  and selected Civil Society Organisations(CSOs) to deliver planned integrated AMR trainings.

Focus Area 4 -National  AMR Surveillance:  Capacity  Systems: At  50%  grading,  priority focus area for Fiji. National human AMR surveillance: Knowing our AMR Burden for sector specific response. Surveillance is the cornerstone for assessing the spread of AMR. It is essential for informing policies and interventions, including diagnostic laboratory capacity, stewardship programmes, supply chain management, and infection prevention and control. Surveillance  is  also  an  indispensable  tool  for  monitoring  new  emerging  patterns  of resistance and for evaluating the effectiveness of local, national and global containment and  mitigation  strategies.  There  is  no  current  system,  however,  one  of  the  aims  of  the COMBAT-AMR  program  (under  NARC  lead)  is  facilitating  discussions  in  the  AMR surveillance systems through the comprehensive situation assessment carried out at the beginning of the program. Fiji CDC has established surveillance systems but AMR is not always incorporated as routine surveillance.

Integrated National Laboratory surveillance capacity  strengthening: Very limited, needs capacity development. HH data is generated but requires additional systems capacity development. AH:

BAF manages animal health AMC data and reports to the WOAH annually, unfortunately this data has never been requested for use by MoA nor MHMS.

National animal AMR surveillance capacity development is currently in progress. Urgent need to establish baseline  data on AMR in pathogenic bacteria of animals, to understand zoonotic AMR risks associated with animals, and to identify trends in AMR.

The veterinary laboratory is unable to conduct regular bacteriology on clinical samples from animals due to supply instability of reagents. The laboratory is unlikely to be sustainable if it only tests clinical animal samples. Hence, it would be more efficient to collate all samples from a wider range of sources such as food, water quality and environmental bacteriology.

A focus on developing a sustainable microbiology service within the veterinary diagnostic laboratory, by diversifying the source of samples tested by the microbiology laboratory, such as,  service  the  culture,  identification  and  AST  of  the  following  sources  of  samples: 1)  Clinically ill and dead animals (milk, post-mortem samples).  2) Testing for zoonotic AMR risks  under  integrated  surveillance  -  samples  from  healthy  animals.    3)  Food  quality samples. 4) Water quality samples.  5) Environmental AMR surveillance samples.

Early warning systems (EWARS) for AMR: EWARS is in place for zoonotic and CDs. Explore inclusion of AMR with Fiji CDC in this phase as per EMAR and NDP strengthening.

Focus  Area  5  -  Reduce  incidence  through  good  Infection  Prevention  &amp;  Control  (IPC) practices: At 60% grading, priority focus area, strengthen IPC in all health care settings (AH and HH). Further advocate to changes in OHS Policy Act 2000 for Workplace Settings in AH and HH.  Explore to  accredit IPC as mandatory continued professional development for cadre annual practising license.

The  updated  national  HH  IPC  Guidelines  was  launched  in  May  2022.  Need  to  roll  out integrated training and secure supply stability of IPC and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) products. COVID-19 public health (PH) requirements endorsed all workplaces, farms, homes to be compliant. This was and can be a BIG WIN -cost-effective and high impact to improve AMR status in Fiji. Link with Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts (MEHA)  Health Promoting Schools &amp; School Health Programs - align to existing partnerships. No Multi-Year Plan (MYP) for immunisation in place. Vaccines Preventable Diseases Vaccines coverage  94%-99%. (WHO Vaccines Monitoring System-2020)

WASH  and vaccinations in community settings: Water and  Sanitation, Hygiene (WASH) and COVID  19  vaccinations  uptake  improved  in  community  settings.  However,  continuity through targeted health education programs, engage Community Health Workers, CSOs, Zone Nurses and AH&amp;EH officers to be trained and provide AMR related health education to their  communities.  Need  to  subsidise  (PPE)  for  farmers  and  improve  water  quality  and supply to rural communities and suburbia.

Programme to promote IPC among the general population including  farmers/food handlers: Not  implemented  by  NARC.  MoA  Animal  Husbandry  team  has  commenced  with  EMAR project.

Standards for infection prevention and control for health care and food-based premises/institutions  exist: Standards  in  place  and  managed  by  the  Food  Unit,  MHMS. Accreditation of formal food premises. Informal including hawkers, aware of requirements for compliance  with Municipalities and Food Unit.

Focus Area 6 - Antimicrobial Stewardship: Optimise use of AMs Human Health  (HH) and Animal Health (AH): At 60% grading, No National AMR Policy in place. Propose to be part of the NAP high level Activity - align using Health in All Policies (HiAP). Include AMR and One Health when updating NMPP, other strategic documents and legal frameworks.

National  Regulatory  Authority  (NRA)  established  and  operational : Recent  review  on  Fiji National  Regulatory  Authority  (NRA),  with  WHO  Global  Benchmarking  with  accreditation towards Maturity Level (ML) 1 by 2025. Antimicrobials (AM) Registration will commence from 2023. Improve proficiency in use of Msupply for NRA team and use mini-labs to test key  AM  quality.  Regular  capacity  building  and  to  train  professionals  in  key  ONE  Health sectors including Fiji Consumer Council, promoting wise use of AMs in communities.

Standard Treatment Guidelines (STGs) and Essential Medicines List (EML) in place for use: Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHS) and AMs STGs in use. COMBAT-AMR intent on AMS and IPC - strengthening support since 2019. EML available online, may need to publish hard

copies for connectivity challenged areas. Training Plan not in place. AMR team to develop as part of NAP tasking and funding.

Surveillance  of  antimicrobial  importation,  use  and  sales  in  humans  and  for  Animal  Use: Importation: MoA issues import permit or prescription to farmers to import AMs for own farm use. BAF monitors antimicrobials requested, ensuring 100 percent compliance  as to that  approved  by  MoA.  Large  scale  commercial   farms,  private  veterinary  clinics,  semicommercial and subsistence farmers rely on MoA.  It is critical to monitor the importation of  feeds containing critical antibiotics or antibiotics of human and animal health importance such as fluoroquinolones, linkages with border control and HH must be strengthend.

Sale  and  Use: MoA  manages  and  monitors  use  of  AMs  by  farmers  at  each  request  to minimise any risk of AMR occurrence.  These include husbandry practices, total stock and condition of farms. MoA maintains a basic database  on antimicrobial use (AMU) for animal health. MoA has twenty-two government veterinary clinics, that administer antibiotics when needed. Private veterinary clinics manage their own AMU records. Information is available at clinics but there is a need for collation of these raw data in order to at least show a true reflection of AMU in the country when it comes to livestock.  These data can be shared with other sectors, if an integrated system is available.

AM Consumption: BAF manages AH AMC importation data and NARC to explore improving partnerships with BAF under the Biosecurity Act 2008. 15  Further strengthening of FRCS role via the Medicinal Products Act 2011, to mandate and develop regulations under the One Health Approach. AH and EH - To develop and integrate AMU surveillance systems (where possible) as part of the EMAR continuity and to regularise for all sectors by 2030.

Supply stability of Antimicrobials - allows for first choice AMs to be prescribed: Poor supply stability, national average 74% for all Essential Medicines. Eastern recorded the lowest at 69%. (Tuapaia IS). Improve data, AMC/WPCRASS initiatives from 2022 onwards. Review Procurement Supply Chain Management and to achieve &gt;80% UHC (Fiji at 61% UHC Index) for all AM as per EML. Msupply roll out and users' proficiencies with regular monitoring by FPBSC and MoA/MoF-especially for AMs used for HH and AH - on tetra and in aqua settings. Link to FRCS and BAF to be aligned and strengthened with good data capture (surveillance) and synthesise for credible AMR intelligence for interventions and decision making. AH: There is no legislation to control the importation and use of antimicrobials in food-producing animals. AMR stewardship programme in health-care settings

AMR stewardship programme in health-care setting: Not regularly conducted due to funding and  Covid  PH  restrictions.  COMBAT-AMR  supported  six  face-to-face  and  seven  online trainings for 529 HH workers from 2019-May 2022. COMBAT-AMR will continue support up

to 2024. AH and HH sectors are encouraged to institutionalise as routine orientation for all sector employees and legal requirement to renew Annual Practicing License (Board and Professional Bodies) for registered AH/HH workers.

Focus Area 7 -Ensure good governance &amp; sustainable investment to combat AMR: At 40% grading,  priority  focal  area.  No  dedicated  funding  was  requested  by  NARC  as  National Medicinal Products Board sub-committee. Grateful to FPBSC for supporting NARC activities since 2015. Strengthen partnerships and "Open Door" policy based on trust plus co-share commonalities  in  activities  such  as  policies,  training,  monitoring  missions.  NARC  to strengthen governance,  coordination and share accountabilities.

AMR at country level and the SDGs: National AMR Coordinator in place, budgeted under FPBSC. AMR ratified as health priority agenda, requires more high-level visibility, not only during WAAW. Commit Improved surveillance for AMC/WPCRASS and GLASS reporting for 2022 data call in 2023. Preposition Quality Improvement Program.  Fiji has  adopted both WHO Access, Watch, Reserve (AWaRe) and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC).

AMR efforts has dedicated financing: Advocate and submit for dedicated budget to fund Plan from Financial Year (FY) 2023. Develop Costing Framework using new WHO Costing Tool for NAP. EMAR and COMBAT-AMR Projects to submit transition plans at least 6 months before completion, transfer and  ownership by MHMS. NARC and respective line ministry to advocate to Quadripartite and other DPs for support.

Research, Development and innovation on AMR prevention and containment: Not in place yet. FNU and HH conducted ad hoc KAP surveys and Quality Use of Medicines. Fiji Consumer Council conducted small customer survey on Doctor Shopping. Findings to be actioned,  and enforce legislations. Academia and DP opportunity to support research and KAP surveys for transformational Policy changes. Fiji is not in a position to develop new antimicrobials including vaccines.

Focus Area 8 -One Health Approach Initiative: At 60% grading,  priority focus, catalytic in ensuring other focus areas will be achieved. Key ministries, public enterprises, development partners (DPs) and CSOs  actively engaged and empowered under the One Health Approach to help in the control of AMR as stipulated in the NAP: NARC - Current representation from EH/Forestry  and  Fisheries  is  uncertain.  NARC  Secretariat  can  proactively  advocate  to strengthen partnerships by identifying focal points from each sector, conducting orientations,  trainings  and  situation  analysis  on  AMR.  MoA  participation  is  good.  DP dialogues for new support can be explored  for the five underperforming focal areas. Engage CSOs through Fiji Consumer Council needs strengthening.

One Health and AMR teams established in each sector: Animal, Environment and Health: HH: Established under FPBSC/Essential  Medicines  Authority.  National AMR  Coordinator supported by MHMS - BIG WIN. EH and AH: Need to choose focal points who are committed and to work with HH Sector. Proposed to rebrand to One Health.

A collaborative forum and  framework for One Health spectrum to enhance efficiency and effectiveness: Opportunity to market One Health NAP against AMR as priority health agenda and link up with IHR, Covid and NCDs for Government. Ratified in  global and regional WHO meetings. Include NAP activities in respective sector budget submissions - both GoF and DP support.

Focus Area 9 -Waste Management: At  50%  grading, high priority focus to implement urgently.

Sanitation, sewage and waste effluent: MWE responsible for safe water, proper sewage &amp; waste effluent management in partnership with MHMS, Water authority of Fiji (WAF) and municipalities. Upgrading of water supply systems under GoF and ADB support critical and in progress.

Effluent and waste from healthcare facilities: Working with MHMS MWE to ensure proper , disposal from all healthcare facilities including use of incinerators, disposal of biological waste/clinical products and expired pharmaceuticals. Align to new National IPC Guidelines, edition 2022.

Use  of  antimicrobials  and  manure  in  crop  production: All  line  ministries  to  liaise  and coordinate proper waste disposal. Key partner BAF and FRCS in the importation and each line ministry to scrutinise permit issuances. Regularly meet to share information, collaborate and enforce Act.

Release  effluent  and  waste  in  animal  production: MoA  and  MWE  to  liaise  strongly  and coordinate  proper  disposal.  Encourage  use  of  Biogas  fuel.  Enforce  training  of  farmers, compliance to guidelines and ensure proper drainage.

Focus Area 10 -Monitoring and Evaluation plus Quality Improvement Program: At  5% grading, high priority focus to implement urgently.

M&amp;E  Framework  to  measure  the  progress  of  implementation  and  achieving  Goals  in managing AMR would be in Fiji: Included in new workplan as Phase 2, develop national level M&amp;E framework to measure progress against all NAP indicators. Develop mutually agreed indicators aligned to SDG, Regional and Local context and include in NSPs for each sector.

## 6. Governance Framework

The governance framework for the National AMR Committee is aligned to the established legal framework of the Government of Fiji. The National AMR Committee will report directly to the Fiji Medicinal Products Board as stipulated in the Fiji Medicinal Products Act 2011 section 24, see Figure 5.   Key development partners and current external project teams such as EMAR and Combat-AMR are represented in respective Technical Working Group.  Refer to Annex 1 for functions and membership of NARC.
