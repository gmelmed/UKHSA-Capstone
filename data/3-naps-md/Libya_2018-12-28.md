## ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

We  wish  to  acknowledge  the  world  health  organization  for  providing  the  support  and leadership in the development of this action plan. We recognize the valuable contributions of the  ministry  of  health  and  national  center  for  disease  control  for  the  development  of  this action  plan.  We  offer  profound  thanks  to  world  health  organization  representative  for  his assistance on achieving the goals. The action plan was made possible through collaboration of  the  planning  committee  and  infection  control  department.    Finally,  we  appreciate  the tireless  efforts  of  the  technical  working  groups  who  gave  so  generously  of  their  time  and expertise.

## INTRODUCTION

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR)  is a critical public health issue globally. Effective antimicrobial  drugs  are  prerequisites  for  both  preventive  and  curative  measures,  protecting patients from potentially fatal diseases and ensuring that complex procedures, such as surgery and chemotherapy, can be provided at low risk. Yet systematic misuse and overuse of these drugs in human medicine and food production have put every nation at risk.

Resistance to antimicrobial medicines is happening in all parts of the world in a broad range of  microorganisms  with  an  increasing  prevalence  that  threatens  human  and  animal  health. The  Global  Action  Plan  (GAP)  on  AMR  was  adopted  in  2015  by  all  countries  through decisions  in  the  World  Health  Assembly,  the  FAO  Governing  Conference  and  the  World Assembly of OIE Delegates. This followed reports of alarming rates of resistance to hospital and community-acquired infections as well as reports of resistance in agriculture, livestock and fisheries. Countries agreed to have a national action plan on AMR that is consistent with the GAP, and to implement relevant policies and plans to prevent, control and monitor AMR

The Libyan national action plan has been aligned with WHO five objectives. Analysis of the current situation and addressing the gaps and the needs to reach the main goal 'one health' approach involves several national sectors and actors, including human and veterinary health, agriculture and food and drug control center and environmental agencies. Therefore, a large committee of all stakeholders was formed with four technical subcommittees were established to addresses every aspect to contain antimicrobial resistance in the country.

Recently, Libya has witnessed a dramatic demographic transformation caused by arrival of large numbers of immigrants that burden the healthcare sector and expected to play a major role  in  threatening  the  national  and  the  international  effort  to  contain  the  antimicrobial resistance,  therefore  an  additional  objective  was  proposed  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  the immigration on the AMR situation in Libya.

A  country  situation  analysis  concluded  in  February  2018,  focused  on  the  concept  of  one health  approach  for  strengthening  systems  to  counter  infectious  diseases  and  related  issues that  threaten  human,  animal,  and  environmental  health.  A  multidisciplinary  team  actively participated  in  this  workshop,  indicated  that  Libya  is  already  experiencing  high  levels  of antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, the workshop was convened to explore immediate, short

and  long-term  actions  and  research  needs  that  will  have  the  greatest  effect  on  reducing antimicrobial  resistance,  while  taking  into  account  the  complexities  of  bridging  different sectors and disciplines to address this global threat.

## OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK

To  achieve  optimal  collaborative  actions  by  different  stakeholders  in  association  with developing partners and international organizations aiming to strength healthcare, veterinary medicine, food safety,  agriculture  and  research.  Libyan  NAP is  structured  around  14  main objectives covering six area of interest: (1) Awareness, education and behavioral change, (2) Surveillance and laboratories capacity , (3) Infection Prevention, hygiene and sanitation , (4) Rational use of antimicrobials, (5) AMR in Migrants  and (6) Reasearch.

- 1. Increase national awareness of AMR among target groups within 5 years up to 85%.
- 2. Improve knowledge on AMR and related topics.
- 3. Enhance  behaviour  change  towards  better  use  of  Antimicrobial  medications  (85% among healthcare workers, and 60% among public).
- 4. Set up a national surveillance system for antimicrobial resistance.
- 5. Build  laboratory  capacity  to  produce  high-quality  microbiological  data  for  patient management and support surveillance activities in both human and animal sectors.
- 6. Identify research priorities for AMR surveillance.
- 7. Strengthening the IPC program in Libya.
- 8. Establishing  bio-security (hygienic  practices) in veterinary settings and  animal husbandry, health food industry and agriculture.
- 9. Sanitation and hygiene at community level.
- 10. Sanitation and hygiene at migrants' camps.
- 11. Ensure sustainable access to high quality antimicrobial medicines.
- 12. Ensure appropriate use of antimicrobial agents in human.
- 13. Improve and ensure appropriate use of antimicrobials in animals.
- 14. Establish the national surveillance system for antimicrobial use and consumption.

## COUNTRY  RESPONSE

## Governance

<!-- image -->

A national  governance  mechanism  is  far  more  likely  to  be  effective  if  it  has  political  support  and authority to act, if it is accountable and if it has dedicated funds and an adequate secretariat to operate.

A governance mechanism is essential for coordinating national efforts to combat AMR. in order to comprise  a  national  steering  committee  (NSC),  which  will  establish  supporting  technical  working group as needed.

## Terms of Reference for a National multi-sectoral steering Committee (NSC)

The main purpose of the national steering committee is to oversee activities.

- 1. Political  support :  As  human  health  is  the  ultimate  concern  of  activities  to  control  AMR,  the ministry of health lead the group, but joint leadership with Ministry of Agriculture and animal worth (MoA), Ministry of Education (MoE) and ministry of Information (MoI).

- 2. Authority to act : The NSC  will have sufficient authority to ensure that the ACC recommendations and plans are implemented.
- 3. Dedicated funds : the availability of dedicated funds will increase the operational effectiveness of the ACC. Seed funds from the government and external sources are often required initially, but government  funds  should  be  secured  as  early  as  possible  to  ensure  political  'ownership'  and increase the likelihood of programme sustainability.

## Terms of references of AMR coordination committee (ACC)

The purpose of the ACC is to oversee and, when necessary, to coordinate AMR-related activities in all sectors to ensure a systematic, comprehensive approach.

## Roles and Responsibility:

- 1. Accountability: The  ACC  should  be  lead  facilitation  or  a  senior  executive  function  in  the government and coordination of a national response to the threat of AMR. Its leadership should take  the  form  of  officially  delegated  authority,  with  more  formal  procedures  and  official monitoring,  evaluation and  reporting.  Moreover  making  recommendations  and progress  reports and providing a platform for programme planning and implementation to NCC.
- 2. Secretariat: Operational  sustainability  is  more  likely  when  sufficient  dedicated  personnel  and funding are available to support administrative activities.
- 3. Information sharing : The ACC should provide a periodic progressing report for information for mutually reinforce activities among sectors to NCDC and UN partners (WHO and IOM) which will be discussed at the regular meeting of NSC.
- 4. Facilitation  and  coordination : ACC  should  facilitate  and,  when  appropriate  and  agreed, coordinate  efforts  to  contain  and  reduce  the  threat  of  AMR  at  subnational,  national  and supranational  levels.  Furthermore,  ACC  should  build  a  collaborative,  cooperative,  supportive environment for sharing knowledge, information and experience. Each participating party should understand the scope and limits of its own contributions and also its inter-dependence with other parties and with the whole system in order to meet the defined goals. The difficulty of achieving such an environment and building such a system should not be underestimated.
- 5. External  interactions :  Collaboration  with  internal  and  external  agencies  and  organizations  is essential for many  countries.  WHO  country  office  can  support  Libya  in  identifying  and facilitating  relations  with  external  partners.  ACC  will  be  invited,  encouraged  and  supported  to participate  in  any  existing  initiatives  of  the  WHO  country  office,  regional  office  or  WHO headquarters.
- 6. Internal interactions : A national AMR initiative must interact with the health system and public health  and disease-specific  programmes and general national plan. The nature of these internal interactions  and  the  results  will  depend  on  ACC.  As  many  agencies  and  programmes  have responsibilities  in  areas  affected  by  AMR,  a  guiding  principle  of  the  ACC  is  to  find  the  most appropriate ways to facilitate and provide synergy with new or existing work so that the overall objectives  of  the  programme  are  achieved.  Furthermore,  the  ACC  must  be  appropriately integrated  and  have  clearly  defined  roles  and  responsibilities  in  existing  health  system,  public health  and  disease-specific  programmes,  animal  health  and  production,  the  food  sector  and environmental initiatives. The cross-cutting nature of the ACC should add value to these systems and programmes, not supplant them.

## Membership of AMR coordination committee:

The national ACC will be composed of members representing the relevant sectors, notably human health, animal health and production and the food and environment sectors, ideally, the head of the ACC will be the national AMR focal point.

Representatives should be given sufficient authority by their institutions to make decisions which will present periodical in NSC regular meeting. While it is important to have sufficient representation of these  key  stakeholders,  the  ACC  should  remain  small  enough  to  be  functional,  striking  a  balance between full representation and the functionality of the coordinating group.

## Meeting format and rules

The meeting format and rules should conform to national norms. Standard operating procedures may be elaborated, transparently and according to the principles of best practice, to guide the activities of the coordinating committee.

Members should be selected to ensure that all relevant stakeholders are equitably represented. NSC members may be invited to propose members of ACC, but the focal point and head of ACC should ensure that the proposed members have sufficient skills, knowledge, authority and influence and can collaborate. It is advisable to achieve a gender balance.

ACC will  form  subcommittees  SOCs  aligned  with  global  strategic  objectives  of  AMR:  awareness raising  and  behaviour  changes,  knowledge,  surveillance,  Infection  Prevention  and  Control  (IPC), hygiene  and  biosecurity  and  rational  antimicrobial  consumption  and  Use.  Each  committee  has  a clearly defined mandate and an appointed chairperson. In addition, technical working groups can be established and mandated for tasks that include providing technical input for ACC decision-making.

The ACC should be supported by an appropriately resourced secretariat responsible for the logistics of meetings; minute-taking; preparation and circulation of documents (e.g. background papers, reports and advisory notes to NSC); and storage and archiving.

The committee should has a mechanism (with appropriate records) to ensure that its members have no conflicts  of  interests  and  that  the  work  of  the  ACC  in  the  interests  of  public  health  is transparent. Failure  to  ensure  these  elements  could  undermine  the  credibility  and  limit  the  effectiveness  of  the committee.

## National focal point

A national AMR focal point should be designated to coordinate AMR activities and tasks in the health sector.

## Scope, roles and responsibilities

The focal point should:

-  Build sustained partnerships and work nationally and internationally on containment of AMR;
-  Identify stakeholders and facilitate formation of an inclusive NSC and ACC.
-  Lead and coordinate drafting of a national action plan for containment of AMR.
-  Facilitate and oversee implementation, M&amp;E of the plan through the ACC.
-  Ensure regular data collection and information sharing by instituting effective communication and  coordination  among  all  stakeholders,  the  members  of  ACC  and  their  constituencies, sectors and disciplines.
-  Coordinate national activities for establishment of AMR surveillance systems.
-  Report  on  the  prevalence  of  and  trends  in  AMR  to  the  global  AMR  surveillance  system (GLASS).

-  The focal point will be the primary contact for all issues related to AMR in the country.

## Technical working group

ACC may decide to form a technical working group (TWG) mandated with specific tasks such as providing technical input, conducting situational analyses or drafting NAPs.

## Scope, roles and responsibilities

The terms of reference (ToR) of the TWG shall be established by the ACC, providing specific scope, role  and  responsibilities.    These  will  usually  be  task-specific,  and  focused  on  areas  which  the coordinating group have determined to be of particular focus for the country.  The TWG will remain a national group and shall interact with country representatives of the required sectors, as determined by the  scope  of  work.    The  TWG  remains  a  group  mandated  by  the  ACC.  As  such,  reporting  and communications with the ACC should be regular and will be defined in the TWG ToR.  Activities may  include  drafting  technical  advice  and  reports,  contributing  to  country  situation  analyses  or participating in national action plan development.

## Membership

Depending on the purpose, scope and tasks of the TWG, membership of a TWG may come from any of  the  relevant  technical  specialities.    These  may  include  experts  from  areas  such  as  infectious diseases,  microbiology,  infection  prevention  and  control,  social  health,  food  and  drug  regulation, surveillance system expertise, environment and others.

## AMR Surveillance Unit (ASU):

Establishing AMR surveillance unit affiliated to the IP&amp;C administration at the NCDC to oversee the development and functioning of the national AMR surveillance system and has multidisciplinary team comprising a range of disciplines: epidemiologist, microbiologists, clinicians, data managers and the focal point for AMR surveillance and reporting to GLASS.

## Term of reference for the ASU:

- 1. Define AMR surveillance objectives within the national AMR strategy.
- 2. Facilitate linkages with AMR  surveillance across human  health, animal health and environmental sectors.
- 3. Develop or adapt national AMR surveillance standards, protocols and tools and coordinate their dissemination.
- 4. Provide guidance and information on data collection and reporting to the national reference laboratory and AMR surveillance sites.
- 5. Monitor and evaluate the AMR surveillance system on an ongoing basis.
- 6. Define strategy for participation in GLASS.
- 7. Assure data management structure and format and IT solutions.
- 8. Select and facilitate enrolment of surveillance sites.
- 9. Coordinate collection and compilation of national AMR data.
- 10. Conduct data analysis and quality assurance.
- 11. Analyse and feedback AMR surveillance results to AMR surveillance sites in collaboration with the national reference laboratory.
- 12. Aggregate and report national AMR data and data on implementation status of national AMR surveillance system to GLASS.

## SITUATIONAL ANALYSES AND ASSESSMENT

Resistance to antimicrobial drugs is a major health problem that affects the whole world. The problem is still worse in developing countries where lack of antimicrobial-resistance surveys and  control  policies are the norm.  In  Libya,  misuse  of  antimicrobial  agents  by  the professional and public is widespread. As in many developing countries antimicrobials can be purchased from pharmacies without prescription in Libya.

Recently,  a  cross-sectional  study  was  carried  out  in  Tripoli  Libya;  found  that  the  overall prevalence of ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae was 24.5%. Klebsiella spp . (54%) and E. coli (34.4%) were the leading ESBL producers. However, these data was higher compared to previous  studies  carried  out  in  Libya  10  -  20.5%  [1-4].  Increased  incidence  of  ESBL infections is also associated with an increase in MDR strains. These results was in agreement with other studies conducted in North Africa: in Algerian hospitals, ESBL existed in 16.4 31.4%; while the prevalence ranged from 11.7 to 77.8% in hospitals and was 0.7 and 7.3% in two communities in Tunisia; and ESBLs were found in 11 - 42.9% of Egyptian samples in both hospitals and communities [5].

Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) has been steadily spreading worldwide during  the  last  decade.  According  to  local  study,  the  occurrence  of  CRE  was  9%  among Enterobacteriaceae isolates. Klebsiella spp . was  the leading carbapenemase  producer (44.6%)  followed  by A. baumannii (24%)  and E. coli (11.6%),  these isolates were autochthonous associated with MDR. Many studies conducted in Libya revealed the presence of  carbapenem  resistant-encoding  genes  (OXA-23,  OXA-48,  NDM-1,  VIM-2  and  GES) contributed  to  antibiotic  resistance  in  Libyan  hospitals  [6-9].  In  the  Mediterranean  basin, during recent years, the emergence of CRE becomes an alarming problem. The prevalence of these CRE is variable across Mediterranean countries [10]. During 2017, extremely high rates of  resistance  to  most  of  the  antimicrobial  agents  tested  among  carbapenem  resistant  Gram negative bacteria isolates, 40% of Acinetobacter spp, 32.6% of P. aeruginosa , and 12.5% of K. pneumoniae were positive for metallo β lactamases isolated in Libya [12]. There is little information on the prevalence of extensively drug resistant (XDR) pathogens in the countries of  North  Africa  (including  Libya)  and  the  Middle  East.  XDR  was  evident  among A. baumannii (61.2%); it was predominantly associated with burn patients [13]. This baseline data should engender further research to investigate the encoding genes associated with the resistant in these isolates in Libya.

A study carried out on self-medication with antibiotics in the ambulatory care setting within eight  countries  of  the  Euro-Mediterranean  region  between  2004-2005  found  that  selfmedication  in  Libya  was  24%  and  nearly  50%  of  interviewed  Libyans  indicated  that  they would  take  antibiotics  for  their  own  use  without  a  prescription  if  they  believe  that  they needed  to  [11].  Lack  of  good  administration,  resources,  maintenance  of  hospitals,  welltrained healthcare workers, and surveillance of different diseases and support of biomedical

research.  The  poor  state  of  health  undoubtedly  aggravated  the  problem  of  antimicrobial resistance in the country.

Establishing monitoring systems based on routine testing of antimicrobial susceptibility and education  of  healthcare  workers,  pharmacists,  and  the  community  on  the  health  risks associated  with  the  problem  and  benefits  of  prudent  use  of  antimicrobials  are  some  of  the steps  that  can  be  taken  to  tackle  the  problem  in  the  future.  Surveillance  of  antimicrobial consumption  and  use  is  desperately  needed.  Information  from  both  surveillance  programs will provide data required to direct policy on the cautious use of antimicrobials and to apprize and  evaluate  resistance  containment  interventions  at  local  and  national  levels.  In  addition, reducing the impact of hospital-acquired infection in our hospitals is urgently required. Such action  will  most  likely  reduce  antimicrobial  use  in  the  hospital  setting  and  may  lead  to  a reduction in high rates of antimicrobial resistance reported from hospitals in Libya. Programs dealing  with  control  of  nosocomial  infections  in  the  country  should  be  strengthened  and updated  regularly.  A  major  component  of  future  policies  for  prevention  and  control  of antimicrobial  resistance  in  Libya  should  be  education  of  healthcare  workers,  pharmacists, students, and the general public.

There  are  many  international  agencies  such  as  WHO,  scientific  societies,  and  other institutions that provide excellent and accurate educational resources that should be used as guidelines.  In addition, local scientific and culture societies, sport clubs, mosques, schools, universities, welfare and correctional centers, and the media should be involved in educating the  community  about  prudent  use  of  antibiotics.  The  crisis  of  antimicrobial  resistance  in Libya  has  reached  a  stage  that  requires  the  ministries  of  health,  agriculture,  information education, and higher education and the research community to join forces in addressing this issue.
