## Executive Summary

Myanmar, as a country going through rapid socio-political transition and institutional development  also  suffers  with  a  high  burden  of  infectious  disease.  An  ongoing challenge has been to effectively reach its 51 million population, most of whom battle tuberculosis,  acute  respiratory  infections,  diarrhoea and malaria  including  amongst under-five children.

Limited research data on the occurrence of resistant organisms in the nation have, makes it hard to estimate the exact antimicrobial resistance (AMR) scenario. Limited peer reviewed evidence indicates significant divergence from the average resistance trends in APAC region.  Nevertheless, several key steps by Government of Myanmar have been instrumental in paving the way for the country to join other nations in the South  East  Asia  Region  to  speed  up  its  plan  on  addressing  the  AMR  crisis. Combating antimicrobial resistance would, however, require highest political commitment, multi-sectoral coordination, sustained investment and technical assistance.

A situation analysis was undertaken in September 2016 using a tool developed by WHO  SEARO  based  on  discussions  between  national multisectoral steering committee members, senior technical leaders of the national health authorities and veterinary sector and  WHO  team.  It  identified opportunities, challenges and implementation  gaps  to  improve  implementation  of  NAP  AMR  in  ways  that  could meet the 68th World Health Assembly (WHA) resolution on AMR.

The indicators  in  the  situation  analysis  protocol  were  grouped  under  the  heads  of National AMR Action Plan in line with GAP-AMR; National AMR surveillance system; Antimicrobial Stewardship and Surveillance of antimicrobial use; Infection Prevention Control in healthcare settings; Awareness raising; Research &amp; innovation and OneHealth  engagement.  Each  of  these  focus  areas  were  consistent  with  the  five strategic objectives of the WHO GAP-AMR, namely the phases of exploration and adoption; programme installation; initial implementation; full operation and sustainable operation.

The situation analysis revealed commitment among political and technical leadership, supporting AMR containment efforts as is reflected in the formation of a National Multi-Sectoral Steering Committee (NMSC). Several existing strengths and initiatives  have  been  mapped  as  building  blocks  of  an  effective  NAP  AMR.  These include  a  strong  laboratory  network,  existing  Infection  control  and  biosecurity programs in human and animal health sectors and a National One Health Strategy which identifies AMR as a priority. A fully functional national drug regulatory authority to oversee regulation and licensing, pharmacovigilance and market authorisation is

another  strong  element  to  leverage.  Next,  initiatives  are  being  taken  to  develop national standards and guidelines such as the national drug policies were updated essential  medicines  lists  and  standard  treatment  guidelines  including  for  antibiotic prescription  are  being  drafted.  Public  health  system  strengthening  is  an  ongoing process while formal campaigns are consolidated or launched focusing on vaccination, sanitation and hygiene at community level.

The National  Action  Plan  on  AMR  for  the  period  2017  -  2022  takes  these  efforts further, reinforcing the government's commitment to make universal healthcare and animal welfare, food security a reality. Based on implementation of the five strategic objectives, each of which has its specific objectives, strategic interventions and key activities, the  NAP  AMR  charts  a  new  phase  in  Myanmar's  journey  towards achieving goals related to AMR compliance.

To  implement  strategic  objective  1  related  to  bridging  knowledge  and  awareness gaps, NAP AMR will establish an evidence-based public communications programme  on  a  national  scale  to  improve  awareness  of  AMR  amongst  general public  and  professionals.  By  2022,  the  country  would  have  carried  out  nationwide evidence  based  awareness  campaigns  with  regular  Monitoring  and  Evaluation (M&amp;E).Necessary  revision  and  pilot  scale  implementation  of  curricular  revisions would also have been undertaken by 2022.

To implement strategic objective 2 related to surveillance of AMR, steps would be taken  to  understand  how  resistance  develops  and  spreads.  This  will  be  done  by building  on  existing  strengths  of  functional  national  hospital  and  public  health laboratory network in human and animal health sectors, having a nationwide AMR surveillance system in place along with a national early warning system to identify early the emergence of resistance in priority pathogens and to critical antimicrobials by 2022.

To  implement  strategic  objective  3  related  to  strengthening  of  hygiene,  infection prevention and control, a national infection prevention and control programme would be implemented in compliance with IPC guidelines within healthcare settings, animal husbandry systems and food production systems. Also, actions to decrease Hospital Acquired Infection (HAI) and associated AMR through facility based HAI surveillance programme  (Human  Health)  would  be  conducted.  Hygiene  and  sanitation  related campaigns  in  community  settings  will  be  conducted  through  systematic  health promotion activities.

To  implement  strategic  objective  4  related  to  optimising  use  of  antimicrobial medicines,  a  national  AMR  containment  policy  would  be  announced  along  with  a series of measures on Antimicrobial Stewardship Programmes  (AMSP)  and Standard  Treatment  Guidelines  (STG)  at  the  national  scale  for  prudent  use  of antimicrobials. Moreover, mechanisms would be established to monitor antimicrobial

usage on a national  scale  to  inform  interventions  to  reduce  overuse  and  promote prudent use of antimicrobial substances. Regulatory structures will be strengthened and newer structures established, especially in veterinary sector.

To  implement  strategic  objective  5  related  to  building  a  case  for  sustainable investments for new medicines, diagnostic tools/vaccines/aids that help bring down use  of  AMR,  it  is  being  mooted  to  build  institutional  capacity  in  the  context  of research  on  AMR.  A  strategic  research  agenda  that  is  relevant  to  the  Myanmar context will be developed and implemented. This will be done in large part, through leveraging existing capacity, build additional capacity as well as through international collaborations.

Most  of  these  activities  will  be  implemented  by  the  key  actors  as  outlined  in  the proposed strategic plan that covers the period 2017-22. Following submission of the final report to the World Health Assembly, the Government of Myanmar will continue with  its  deliberations  and  planning  process  under  the  leadership  of  National  MultiSectoral Steering Committee (NMSC).

## Background

## Setting the Context: From Global to National Action Plans

Antimicrobial  resistance  (AMR)  has  emerged  as  one  of  the  biggest  public  health threats of the modern epoch. At the 68 th World Health Assembly (WHA) in May 2015, a  global  action  plan  on  AMR  (GAP  AMR)  was  adopted  in  response  to  the acknowledgement of this emerging crisis (1). The GAP AMR has been developed at the  request  of  the  Health  Assembly  in  keeping  with  resolution  WHA67.25  of  May 2014, which was reflective of the global consensus that AMR was a major threat to human health.

The GAP AMR has advocated for the One Health approach to form the basis for the global  response  to  AMR,  especially  in  case  of  developing  countries,  which  are expected  to  contribute  to  the  increasing  trends  of  antimicrobial  agent  (AMA) consumption  and  therefore,  likely  to  be  at  a  higher  risk  of  emerging  resistant microbes (2-4).  The  need  for  this  was  further  stressed  at  the  2015 WHA  through resolution WHA68.7. 1

Consolidating the position of the GAP AMR, the global political will come together to further commit to the cause of containment of AMR at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) at the high level meeting on AMR on 21 September, 2016, in New York (5). At this meeting, global leaders committed to 'taking a broad, coordinated approach to address the root causes of AMR across multiple sectors, especially in human health, animal health and agriculture' (5).

One of the overarching requirements outlined by the GAP AMR was that all Member States  (MS)  should  develop  their  own,  tailor  made  National  Action  Plans  on  AMR (NAP AMR), duly aligned with the principles and approaches espoused by the GAP AMR by May 2017. 2

The  process  of  framing  a  contextually-driven  NAP  AMR  will  provide  a  baseline understanding of the local AMR situation, along with highlighting gaps and available capacities.  This  will  serve  as  valuable  information,  allowing  different  countries  to customise their NAP AMR as per their local realities.

The process of framing a NAP AMR for Myanmar was initiated through a situation analysis, which provided details of the existing AMR situation, gaps and capacity in the local context.

## Situation Analysis and Assessment

Located in Southeast Asia, with total area of 676,600 square km and population of 51 million, Myanmar is surrounded by India and Bangladesh on the west and China, Laos and Thailand on the South East(6). In 2011, the country installed its first civilian government. Ever since, the country has been going through rapid and significant socio-political changes and institution building.

Myanmar is known to be surrounded by porous borders with neighbouring countries. This  has  not  only  socio-political  implications  but  implications  for  movement  of diseases and pathogens alongside humans and animals including drug resistance pathogens. Porous borders have also been implicated in illegal movement of drugs and  pharmaceuticals  for  both  humans  and  animals  that  may  or  may  not  be  of optimum quality (7).

Compared to other countries in Southeast Asia, Myanmar lags behind on key health indicators(8).  The  country  suffers  from  a  high  Infectious  diseases  burden  which contribute  to  result  in  greatest  proportion  of  the  number  of  years  of  life  lost,  HIV prevalence  and  malaria  incidence  nearly  double  the  respective  regional  averages (8). High infectious disease burden and its complexity is also represented by high TB incidence and MDR TB, the latter being among highest in the region at double the regional average(9).

High  MDR  TB  rate  could  also  be  considered  an  indicator  of  the  problem  of antimicrobial resistance(AMR)  in general, among  common  pathogens  in  both hospital  and  ambulatory  settings.  Given  multifactorial  origin  of  AMR  as  a  result  of antimicrobial  use  (AMU)  in  human,  animal  and  food  production  sectors,  it  is important to understand the nature and extent of problem and its drivers including socio-cultural, system and policy drivers. This understanding is necessary to inform interventions  for  effective  containment  of  AMR.  However,  with  the  exception  of malaria,  there  is  extremely  limited  peer  reviewed  evidence  or  grey  literature  on existing  situation  of  AMR  in  common  bacteria  in  Myanmar  in  hospital  as  well  as community settings in both human and animal sectors.

In the scenario  of  limited local production,  antimicrobials  such  as  β-lactams, tetracycline, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, macrolides and sulphonamides and most  are  imported  from  Asian  and  European  countries  (personal  communication

from Director General(DG) (Department of Food &amp; Drug Administration). However, limited evidence exists on AMR burden, AMU and their trends in Myanmar.

Documented  evidence  doesn't  allow  comparison  with  regional averages. For example,  in  a  study  on  hospitalised  patients  during  2009  to  2013  in  Myanmar, resistance to Enterococcus spp, to ampicillin was reported as 30.8% and 68.8% to erythromycin  (10).  This  is  much  lower  than  the  APAC  regional  average  of  68.5% resistant  to  ampicillin  in Enterococcus reported  in  2011  (11).  Some  evidence  on AMR  in  Myanmar  has  been  reported  from  studies  conducted  in  border  areas,as these areas have been more accessible to patients and samples in the past. In a study  on  non-pregnant  adults  on  the  Thailand-Myanmar  border  in  2013-2014, resistance  percentage  in E.coli was  reported  as:  ampicillin  70.1%,  ceftriaxone 20.9%,  co-amoxiclav  7.5%,  cotrimoxazole  62.7%,  Ciprofloxacin  20.9%,  gentamicin 20.9%, nitrofurantoin &amp; meropenem 0%. These rates are again significantly different from  APAC  averages:  44.6%  to  co-amoxiclav,  cotrimoxazole  64.4%,  ceftriaxone 59.4%, gentamicin 42.6%, meropenem  3.3% (12). Similar unexpectedly low resistance  was  reported  to  common  bacterial  isolates  in  blood  cultures  from paediatric patients in Yangon Children Hospital (13).

The rising problem of AMR in Myanmar has however, been demonstrated by Lestari et  al.  in  their  review  of  literature  of  peer  reviewed  publication  between  January  1, 1995  and  January  1,  2007(14).  In  1984  and  1985,  no  resistance  to  trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole  was  observed  among Shigella spp  in  Myanmar,  in  1989  it  was 48%  and  in  1993,  63%  of  isolates  were  resistant.  In  Myanmar,  tetracycline resistance among Shigella spp increased over the years from 0% in 1980, 41% in 1984, 63% in 1985, 90% in 1991 to 91% in 1993. For  chloramphenicol, there has been a steady increase in resistance rates over the years in Myanmar: from 0% in 1980, 41% in 1984, 63% in 1985, 75% in 1989, 90% in 1990 to 91% in 1993(14).

## Antimicrobial  resistance  and  use  in  animal  health,  aquaculture  and  food production sectors

Agriculture  is  the  backbone  of  the  Myanmar  economy:  the  sector  contributes  to 37.8% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), accounts for 25 to 30 % of total export earnings and employs 70 % of the labour force (15). Livestock and fisheries account for  20%  of  agricultural  GDP  of  Myanmar  (16).  Livestock  and  fisheries  sector  is proposed to expand to achieve food security and self-sufficiency. National livestock policy  has  laid  large  emphasis  on  poultry  production  as  well  as  dairy  cattle  while retaining a rural focus and strengthening small holder animal farms (15).

While  both  marine  and  inland  fisheries  are  responsible  for  majority  of  production, increased  emphasis  to  harness  the  potential  of  aquaculture  is  reflected  in  special plans  of  Government  of  Myanmar.  Special  livestock  and  fisheries  development committees and task forces have been set up in the past to work on a multi-year

plans for  extended  breeding  and  production  of  fish  and  shrimp  including  technical support from global knowledge institutes (17,18).

Alongside the growth of incomes and population, the demand for livestock products is  expected rise sharply: for poultry meat the market is expected to grow annually with 15%. The market growth for dairy products is expected to be even higher: 30 100% in the upcoming 10 years (17). Rapid increase in production of livestock and aquaculture are known to involve intensive approaches that make animals prone to infections  and  therefore  lead  to  greater  need  for  AMAs  which  is  reflected  in  the recent  projections.  Based  on  livestock  intensification  patterns,  China,  Brazil  and India  are  current  hotspots,  and  future  hotspots  are  Myanmar,  Indonesia,  Nigeria, Peru and Vietnam (19). Currently in SEA, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Myanmar are the three leading consumers of antimicrobials for farm use on a total per-country basis. Among the 50 countries with the largest amounts of antimicrobials used in livestock in  2010,  the  five  countries  with  the  greatest  projected  percentage  increases  in antimicrobial  consumption  by  2030  are  likely  to  be  Myanmar  (205%),  Indonesia (202%), Nigeria (163%), Peru (160%), and Vietnam (157%) (20). Similarly, aquaculture sector is known to be a major consumer of antibiotics in SEA andaquatic environments  of  the  region  have  been  found  to  contain  antibiotics  and  AMR genes(21,22).  However,  no  evidence  exists  on  the  extent  of  use  of  AMAs  in  this sector in Myanmar.

National policy on the sale or use of antimicrobials in animals and animal feed is not well established in Myanmar. Most of antimicrobials used in livestock production are imported; major classes of antimicrobials, used in livestock production in Myanmar are  beta-lactams,  tetracycline,  fluoroquinolone,  aminoglycoside,  macrolides  and sulphonamides. Studies indicate that up to 10% of poultry meats from retail market have been found to be positive for residue of antibiotics  such  as fluoroquinolones (23).

Myanmar has a major existing problem of inappropriate use of antimicrobials, and most farmers use antimicrobials without any consultation by veterinarians (23). It is expected  therefore  that  AMR  is  significant  problem  in  the  livestock  and  food production sectors.

Similar  to  human  clinical  isolates,  among  ASEAN  countries,  data  on  AMR  and foodborne  pathogens  are  limited in Myanmar  and  therefore  doesn't  allow  a meaningful  comparison  with  regional  trends(24).  Data  based  on  a  student  thesis reveals  that Salmonella strains  in  raw  food  products  in  retail  markets  in  Yangon, Myanmar were all resistant to tetracycline (24). In a study on poultry meat, Escherichia coli isolates were reported to be resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol,  oxytetracycline,  and  neomycin  (69.23%  to  61.53%).  Moderate resistance  to  antibiotics  was  observed  with  ciprofloxacin  (46.15%).  Gentamycin showed the lowest resistance (7.6%). On the other hand, resistance of E. coli O157

isolates  from  fresh  beef  samples  of  retail  market  ranged  from  ciprofloxacin  (25%) and  gentamycin  (87.5%),  to  sulfamethoxazole/  trimethoprim  (12.5%).  Antibiotic resistance  of E.  coli isolated  from  rectal  swab  samples  of  piglets  showed  100% resistance  to  ampicillin  and  oxytetracycline  and  resistance  to  chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin,  gentamycin  and  sulfamethoxazole/  trimethoprim  reported  as  75%, 75%, 83.3% and 91.6%, respectively(23).

## Situation analysis of AMR containment efforts in Myanmar

A  situation  analysis  was  undertaken  in  Myanmar  in  September  2016  using  a  tool developed by WHO SEARO. The specific objectives of the situation analysis were:

-  To  conduct  the  situation  analysis  prior  to  strengthening  and  developing  the National  Action  Plan,  aligning  with  Global  Action  Plan  to  determine  the baseline  regarding  implementation  and  functionality  in  terms  of  sufficient qualified human resources, funding and functional structures of command and coordination of AMR program in the country;
-  To  identify  opportunity,  challenges  and  implementation  gaps  in  order  to improve the overall NAP implementation;
-  Assist Myanmar to identify vulnerabilities, opportunities and needs to meet the 68th WHA resolution on AMR and prioritise the activities for AMR containment as per NAP;
-  To facilitate  WHO  in  fulfilling  its  commitment  to  report  on  the  development, implementation,  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  NAP-AMR  and  to  identify priority areas for WHO to support.

The  situation  analysis  process  comprised  of  guided  discussions  between  the National AMR Multisectoral Steering Committee members, senior technical leaders of  national  health  authorities  and  veterinary  sector,  and  WHO  team.  The  situation analysis  looked  at  how  well  developed  the  AMR  programme  was  in  terms  of governance,  policy  and  systems  and  its  review  focused  on  broad  system  wide analysis rather than assessing quality of policies and documents.

The indicators in situation analysis protocol were grouped into seven focus areas: 1. National  AMR  Action  Plan  in  line  with  GAP-AMR;  2.  National  AMR  surveillance system;  3.  Antimicrobial  Stewardship  and  Surveillance  of  antimicrobial  use;  4. Infection Prevention Control in healthcare settings; 5. Awareness  raising; 6. Research  &amp;  innovation;  and  7.  One-Health  engagement.  These  focus  areas  were consistent with the five strategic objectives of the WHO GAP-AMR.

Each of the focus areas was comprised of a list of sub-focus areas. Each sub-focus area was graded on five levels to show the incremental extent of AMP programme implementation. These five levels of phases are stated as follows: Phase 1: Phase of exploration  and  adoption;  Phase  2:  Phase  of  programme  installation;  Phase  3:

Phase of initial implementation; Phase 4: Phase of full operation; Phase 5: Phase of sustainable operation (14).

A thematic situation analysis was conducted based on the phases in which each of the  indicators  were  placed  in.  The  phases  reflect  phases  of  the  installation  and implementation of the AMR containment program in terms of governance, policy and system.  Phases  1  and  2    relate  to  policy  development  and  planning  but  no implementation;  Phases  3  to  5  are  related  to  different  levels  of  implementation including  initial  implementation;  phase  of  full  operation;  and  phase  of  sustainable operation. These phases from 3 to 5 are the strengths of the system. Sustainable operation  is  considered  best  practice  and  defined  here  as  an  operation  that incorporate an M&amp;E system.

Figure  1  shows  the  status  of  implementation  of  AMR  containment  programme  in Myanmar. Green colour indicates complete implementation, yellow indicates partial implementation and red implies no implementation. Following were the findings from the Government of Myanmar-WHO Situational Analysis:

## National AMR Action Plan in line with GAP-AMR

Myanmar has not started developing a National Action Plan for AMR containment. A national  multisectoral  steering  committee  has  been  announced  with  the  Deputy Director General of National Health Laboratory (NHL) identified as the National Focal Point. Further governance mechanisms to implement plans under different strategic objectives and interventions will be developed as part of the NAP AMR.

## Awareness raising

Awareness efforts in different target groups have been limited and ad hoc and have ranged  from  Continuous  Medical  Educations(CMEs)  for  professionals  (general practitioners)  by  public  hospitals  and  professional  societies  (by  Myanmar  Medical Association  and  General  Practitioners'  Society)  (25)to  modular  (NOT  curricular) teaching in professional courses. These efforts have been organized in the last 1-2 years. Limited or no efforts have been made to understand and address awareness needs of wider target groups base.

## National AMR surveillance system

An AMR surveillance system that captures standardized epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data on AMR has not been set up in Myanmar. Myanmar has  a strong culture of diagnostic microbiology laboratory network. The NHL is the apex lab and coordinating  centre  for  nearly  1123  hospital  laboratories  across  the  country  at different levels. The NHL provides referral and advisory services to other verticals in MoHS such as DG FDA and Disease Control Programmes under DG Public Health. Data mostly in paper based form flows from hospital laboratories at different level to

the NHL  and is comprised of isolates and their AST  results without any epidemiological information. Data is converted to electronic form (excel data) at the level of NHL followed by limited analysis which is not real time. A long standing QA program  run  nationwide  as  a  national  EQAS  by  NHL  is  another  strength  of  the laboratory network.

A national referral laboratory for AMR surveillance is yet to be identified. However, the recently approved and published Myanmar National Policy on Health Laboratories identifies a central and apex role for NHL(26).

In the absence of systematic data collection and analysis of AMR trends, an early warning  system  for  emerging  trends  drug  resistance  trends  is  not  operational  in Myanmar.  Situation  analysis  revealed  some  anecdotal  evidence  of  hospital  level analysis  on  a  case-to-case  basis  following  identification  of  unusual  resistance patterns.

## Antimicrobial Stewardship and Surveillance of antimicrobial use

An overwhelming majority of the AMAs used in Myanmar are imported. Import data provides an opportunity to monitor their use through sales data. Similarly, surveillance for use  in hospital and  ambulatory  care  settings has  not been operationalised.

AMSP as an important strategy for monitoring  and  improving  the  use  of  AMAs  in different  health  care  settings  is  yet  to  be  introduced  in  Myanmar's  health  sector. Notably, a National Standard  Treatment  Guidelines, the treatment guidelines including for use of AMAs is guided by guidelines issued by professional societies and  adapted  by  local  physicians  and  surgeons  in  the  hospitals.  Local  STGs  are seldom guided by local AMR surveillance data.

The institution of DG FDA is the fully functional national drug regulatory authority and well established as a national network. However, challenges in effective drug control include, majorly imported medicines, limited human  resources for regulatory enforcement, limited oversight of veterinary drugs and pharmaceutical even though regulated  by  DG  FDA,  lack  of  awareness  on  AMR  and  AMU  among  stakeholder across the board and a significant problem of OTC sales of AMAs in both human and animal sectors. While, the WHO prequalified anti-tuberculosis drugs ensure optimum quality in national TB program, AMAs for common infections including malaria suffer from issues of quality, counterfeit drugs and illegal imports from across international borders.

## Infection Prevention Control in healthcare settings

Infection control and patient safety policy was introduced in health care settings by MoHS some years ago. Infection Control Committees (ICC) and teams are in place

under  the  policy  with  infection  control  guidelines.  However,  except  for  limited activities related to education and training in hand hygiene, standard precautions and additional (transmission related) precautions, there is limited activity of ICCs. Quality of  microbiology  laboratory  testing  is  assured  by  virtue  of  being  part  of  the  NHL quality assured  network.  However,  there  is  limited  to  no  analysis  of  hospital associated  infections  data,  AMR  surveillance  and  AMU  data  to  prevent  infections and improve of AMAs. Resource constraints including human resource constraints and  lack  of  standards  and  guidelines  were  often  cited  as  the  reasons  for  IPC programmes not being implemented to their fullest potential.

## Research &amp; innovation

In spite of modest institutional capacity, AMR research has not caught the attention of the research community as is reflected in limited peer reviewed publication base from  Myanmar.  Opportunistic  research  is  carried  out  in  clinical  settings  to  fulfil mandatory  academic  requirements.  A  strategic  research  agenda  and  priorities  for Myanmar are yet to be identified. A recent publication has highlighted the acute need for research in program planning and resource allocation but also the need for health systems,  policy  and  burden  research  on  AMR  in  tuberculosis  control  and  MDR TB(27). International collaborations have been established recently by the NHL with global  centres  of  excellence  such as  Pasteur Institute,  Cambodia, National Centre for Global Health and Medicine, Japan and Niigata University, Japan.

## One-Health engagement

Avian  influenza  outbreaks  have  brought  together  the  human  and  animal  health sectors  in  the  form  of  coordination  mechanisms.  As  a  further  step,  a  One  Health Strategy has recently formulated with a One Health Secretariat being proposed and led by Central Epidemiology Unit at MoHS. One Health platform will undertake joint surveillance and response on six priority diseases (avian influenza, rabies, anthrax, tuberculosis, Japanese encephalitis, food borne zoonoses) and AMR.

Animal health sector in general lags further behind in AMR containment efforts. AMR containment  policy,  AMR  surveillance,  AMSP  and  awareness  programs  have  not been initiated. The zoning related interventions following HPAI outbreaks in poultry are examples  of  biosecurity  and  hygiene  related  interventions  that could  be expanded to other settings. Recently The Myanmar Pig Partnership, under the aegis of  Zoonoses  and  Emerging  Livestock  Systems  (ZELS)  project  was  launched  in Myanmar. The Project is an interdisciplinary research project exploring the disease risk thought to be accompanying changing pig production and consumption patterns in Myanmar. It has helped set up basic bacterial culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing facility  at  the  Veterinary  Diagnostic  Laboratory  (Yangon).  AMR  surveillance on a pilot scale is carried out from different sites in and around Yangon area with the help  of  local  Veterinary  Officers.  Clinical  samples  and  samples  from  piggeries,

poultry farms, slaughterhouses and feed samples are collected on a monthly basis and tested for presence of bacterial pathogens and screened for AMR. Few private farms  have  started  submitting  samples  for  culture  and  sensitivity  to  the  VDL (Yangon).Similarly,  limited  capacity  for  drug  and  residue  testing  is  available  at Veterinary Assay Laboratory which is responsible for testing for drug quality before registering a veterinary drug for import and use in Myanmar. However, this has not been organized into a systematic surveillance system.

One  of  the  major  constraint  in  controlling  AMU  in  veterinary  sector  has  been  the absence  of  regulatory  control  of  veterinary  sector  on  licensing,  regulating  and controlling  AMAs.    Veterinary  sector  is  only  mandated  to  recommend  and  register AMAs requisitioned by animal production units. The regulatory control by DG FDA at MoHS lacks effectiveness at the field level.

Overall,  AMR containment efforts in Myanmar are in the phase of exploration and adoption  in  different  focus  areas  with  initial  implementation  in  awareness  and hygiene/sanitation  and  laboratory  surveillance;  drug  regulation  is  in  process  of achieving full operation (Figure 1).

## National Action Plan on AMR (2017 - 2022)

## Goal, Objectives and Guiding Principles

The  goal  of  the  GAP  AMR  is:  'to  ensure,  for  as  long  as  possible,  continuity  of successful  treatment  and  prevention  of  infectious  diseases  with  effective  and  safe medicines that are quality-assured, used in a responsible way, and accessible to all who need them.'

To achieve this, the GAP-AMR has laid down five strategic objectives which form the basis  for  developing  public  health  response  to  AMR  globally.  These  strategic objectives are:

Objective 1: Improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance through effective communication, education and training

Objective 2: Strengthen the knowledge and evidence base through surveillance and research

Objective 3: Reduce the incidence of infection through effective sanitation, hygiene and infection prevention measures

Objective 4: Optimize the use of antimicrobial medicines in human and animal health

Objective 5: Develop the economic case for sustainable investment that takes account of the needs of all countries, and increase investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions

Additionally, the NAP AMR is expected to reflect the five principles based on which the  GAP  AMR  strategies  have  been  enunciated.  These  include: Whole-of-society engagement  including  a  One  Health  approach,  Prevention  first,  Access, Sustainability, and Incremental targets for implementation(GAP).

## NAP Development Process

The  development of NAP  has  followed the guidelines enshrined in WHO's 'Antimicrobial  resistance:  A  manual  for  developing  national  action  plans'  (World Health  Organization  2016).  The  approach  is  structured  around  the  five  strategic objectives and five principles which are embodied by the GAP AMR (World Health Organization 2015).

Within  the  five  strategic  objectives  of  the  GAP  AMR,  12  specific  objectives  have been included. Each of these specific objectives has been described in terms of a Strategic Intervention, with a defined  set of key  activities to be  carried out successfully to execute the strategic intervention and eventually to fulfil the strategic objective.  Key  Monitoring  &amp; Evaluation  (M&amp;E)  indicators have been listed for activities  under  each  of  the strategic interventions with the operational plan comprising of broad planning by activity. Detailed planning along with the budget allotted for the respective  activities  will  be done in due course by national stakeholders.

The NAP thus consists of the Situation Analysis and Assessment, a Strategic Plan, an  Operational  Plan  as  described  in  the  WHO  guidance  manual  and  a  Sample template (28,29).

The Situation Analysis by WHO SEARO focused on how well developed the AMR programme  is  in  terms  of  governance,  policy  and  system  formed  the  basis  for identifying  gaps  and  strategic  priorities  (World  Health  OrganizationSEARO,  2016). The  situation  analysis  was  further  supported  by  literature  review  including  grey literature provided by country level stakeholders.

Based  on  the  extent  of  implementation,  each  of  the  strategic  interventions  was graded on an incremental scale consisting of five phases adapted from the Indicator Standards  Assessment  Tool  developed  by  UNAIDS(30).  The  first  phase,  that  of exploration and adoption, indicates that the process of designing an AMR containment  programme  has  been  initiated.  Once  the  decision  to  implement  the programme  has  been  made,  systems  progress  to  the  second  phase,  that  of programme installation. The third phase, of initial implementation, is one of the most challenging phases  for programmes  in  developing  countries.  Once  the  early implementation  barrier  is  overcome  and  the  programme  is  scaled  up,  the  fourth stage - full operation - is achieved. Once the programme starts to function at the highest grade of operational efficiency, the fifth and final stage, that of sustainable operation, is attained.

Findings from the Situation Analysis helped situate the current state of NAP in the country  along  the  incremental  scale.  To  enable  the  country  to  make  the  most progress  towards  implementing  NAP,  GAP  principle  of  'Incremental  targets  for

implementation'  was  followed  with  the  ultimate  aim  of  achieving  phase  5  of sustained  operations.  Flexibility was  built into the planning  process  including monitoring  and  reporting  arrangements,  in  order  to  allow  the  country  to  determine priority actions that it needs to take in order to attain the five strategic objectives and implement  actions  in  a  step-wise  manner  that  meets  both  local  needs  and  global priorities.

NAP  development  involved  the  process  of  participative  dialogue  with  important stakeholders and informants. Further expansion into a detailed operational by sub activities  and  validation  will  be  done  by  country  team  and  stakeholders.  Technical support was provided by WHO Country office, WHO SEARO and the Consultant.

## Country Response

## Governance

A  national  multi-sectoral  governance  mechanism  is  the  pivot  around  which  AMRrelated activities can be effectively coordinated in all the relevant sectors. This will ensure a systematic and comprehensive approach. However, the scope should be broad  enough  to  address  all  five  strategic  objectives  of  the  global  action  plan, prioritising activities in a step-wise approach.

The  governance  mechanism  for  Myanmar  will  comprise  of  a  High  Level  National Multi-sectoral Steering Committee (NMSC), for antimicrobial resistance. NMSC will be  supported  by  a  National  AMR  Coordinating  Centre  and  multi-sectoralTechnical Working Groups who  will address the strategic objectives of GAP  through specialised Task Forces on related to the five strategic objectives of GAP. Each of these will be formed and will function as per the following criteria.

## National  Multisectoral  Steering  Committee  (NMSC)  for  Antibiotic Resistance

The NMSC will provide the necessary political commitment and support for national AMR  containment  efforts in Myanmar  and  to  the  international global health community. Given the ultimate goal of AMR containment efforts that are geared to improve human health outcomes, the NMSC will be formed under the leadership of MoHS with MoHS as the Chairperson.

## Composition of NMSC:

The  NMSC  will  be  chaired  by  Minister  for  Health  &amp;  Sports  and  Co-Chaired  by Minister for Agriculture Livestock&amp; Irrigation. Its membership will be as follows:

-  Minister of Health and Sports (Chairman)
-  Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Health and Sports (Co-chair)
-  Members - 22

## National AMR Coordinating Centre (NACC)

The NACC will be the implementation agency for NAP AMR and will draw its powers and  mandate  from  Ministerial  Decree  while  NMSC  will  provide  strategic  vision  to AMR control efforts. The NACC will provide the platform for programme planning and implementation  through  a  supporting  structure  comprising  of  technical  working groups for individual strategic objectives.

The NACC is envisioned as a multi-sectoral group of senior programme managers from different ministries with adequate representation of non-governmental agencies, cooperatives, civil society representatives, media, international agencies (WHO/FAO/OIE). By way of its multi-sectoral  composition,  it  will  ensure  adequate integration of AMR containment efforts into the existing health system, public health and  disease-specific  programmes,  animal  health  and  production  food  sector  and other environmental initiatives.

It will be chaired by Deputy Director General (Labs) and its Secretariat will be located in NHL, Yangon. Its membership will be drawn from the:

## Forming Technical Working Groups

Technical  working  group  (TWG)  will  form  an  integral  part  of  the  governance mechanism in Myanmar. These will be multi-sectoral in composition and will report to the  NACC. They  will  be  formed a  priory and  will  be  mandated  with  specific  tasks such  as  providing  technical  input,  conducting  situational  analyses,  drafting  NAPs, planning  and  budgeting,  commissioning  specialised  task  forces  and  overseeing implementation of strategic interventions and corresponding key activities under the five strategic objectives.

The proposed thematic TWGs that will be formed include:

- 1. Awareness
- 2. Surveillance
- 3. Infection Prevention and Control and Hygiene
- 4. Optimizing Antimicrobial Use
- 5. Research and Innovation

Each  of  the  TWGs  will  be  responsible  for  programme  planning  and  budgeting referring to NAP on AMR while focusing on One Health and for coordinating between the different agencies and secretariats. They will assume charge for monitoring and evaluation and based on their interactions and review mechanisms come up with a set of workable recommendations.

The 5 TWGs will be mandated by the NACC and will report to their Chairpersons and to the National Focal Point of the NACC. The organisational structure, composition,

locus of coordination centre and general terms of reference are listed below. Specific jobs of individual TWGs have been detailed in the Strategic Plan Document.

## General Terms of References of Technical Working Groups

Technical working group (TWG) will be multi-sectoral in composition and will report to the NACC. In their respective strategic objective, the TWG will:

## Strategic Plan

The  strategic  plan  for  Myanmar's  NAP  AMR  is  based  on  implementation  of  five strategic objectives, each of which has its objectives, strategic interventions and key activities

## Strategic Objective 1: AWARENESS

The  GAP  AMR  has  identified  the  need  to  raise  awareness  of  AMR  and  promote behavioural change through public communication programmes that target different audiences  in  human  health,  animal  health  and  agricultural  practices  as  well  as  a wide range of consumers related to these sectors. The GAP AMR has also focused on making AMR  a  core component of the professional education training, certification,  continuing  education  and  development  in  the  health  and  veterinary sectors  and  agricultural  practice.  This approach  is  expected  to  foster  proper understanding and awareness amongst professionals.

The Situation Analysis revealed that awareness program on AMR in different sectors is yet to be formalised. Limited and ad hoc CMEs and trainings have been conducted by tertiary care hospitals, professional societies and veterinary universities. Awareness  for  general  public  and  other  relevant  stakeholders  such  as  livestock farmers have not been conducted.

By 2022, Myanmar will carry out nationwide evidence based awareness campaigns with regular M&amp;E. The aim is also to revise curricula in undergraduate medical and veterinary,  food  industry  and  agriculture  teaching  and  Continuous  Professional Development courses. Revised curricula will be implemented on a limited scale but with regular audits. The Strategic Plan is as follows:

## Objective 1.1: To improve awareness of AMR amongst the general public and professionals

Strategic intervention 1.1 Establish an evidence-based public communications  programme  targeting audiences in policy making, human and animal health practice, the general public and professional on prudent use of antimicrobials

Strategic  intervention  1.2  Include  AMR  and  related  topics  such  as Infection Prevention  Control  as  a  core  component  of  professional education, training, certification and Development for health care providers and veterinarians

## KEY ACTIVITIES

Under the overall supervision of TWG (Awareness):

2017-18

- 1. Task Force commissioned in 1.1 will conduct KAP Studies on a national scale to assess awareness levels and gaps in knowledge  in  professional  groups  on  AMR,  hygiene  &amp;amp;  IPC, environmental relationships. Priority professional groups will include:specialist physicians/surgeons, general practitioners, veterinarians, para-veterinarian, paramedics, nursing staff, environmental  health  specialists,  agriculture/production  experts, ministry officials of relevant departments and policymakers.

2019-20

- 2. DG ,  Department  of  Human  Resource  for  Health  (DoHRH)and MoALI  counterpart,  under  technical  guidance  of  Ministry  of Education,  and  in  collaboration  with  Medical  and  Veterinary Councils  will  undertake  revision  for  professional  development courses  (human  and  animal  health,  the  food industry and agriculture). Proposals submitted by Directorate of Medical Services and  ongoing module  for undergraduate  veterinary curriculum will be reviewed for their suitability for new curricular strategies.  Roll  out  of  courses  will  be  done  on  a  limited  scale along with concurrent regular audits followed by nationwide scale up.

2020-22

- 3. AMR  and  related  topics  will  be  incorporated  in  undergraduate and postgraduate curricula in human and animal health, the food industry and agriculture.

## Responsible Agency

MoHS, MoALI, MoE

## Partners and Stakeholders

WHO, FAO, OIE, NGOs &amp; INGOs, MMA, MNA

## Illustrative Indicators

-  Awareness levels by professional groups
-  Number of revised curricula for target professional groups
-  Audit reports of professional courses

## Strategic Objective 2: SURVEILLANCE OF AMR

The GAP AMR identifies the need to establish an evidence based surveillance for AMR in the nation and identifies the following critical information/evidence gaps:

-  Descriptive epidemiology of resistant organisms as they emerge
-  Understanding how resistance develops and spreads
-  The ability to rapidly characterise the emergent resistant organisms
-  Understanding  social  sciences,  behavioural  and  other  research  needed  for holistic fulfilment of all five strategic objectives
-  Treatment and prevention of infections, especially in the low resource settings
-  Basic and translational research to support the development of new treatments, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions
-  Alternatives to non-therapeutic uses of antimicrobial agents in the context of agriculture, aquaculture and their use in crop protection
-  Economic research

The  situation analysis revealed  that several elements  of  systematic  AMR surveillance are not in place in different sectors such as surveillance standards/guidelines, systematic data collection and analysis including electronic reporting and recording and linkage with HAI surveillance. Human health sector is ahead  with  a  strong  quality  assured  network  of  laboratories  performing  AMR testing. Disease Control Programs, especially TB, also have an advanced system of  AMR  testing.  However,  animal  health  sector  has  only  a  very  recent  pilot initiative in place.

By 2022, Myanmar will consolidate its strengths in AMR surveillance and develop a high quality AMR surveillance system on a limited scale that will integrate AMR surveillance  in  laboratories,  hospitals,  AMU  and  surveillance  in  animal  sectors. By  2022,  a  national  early  warning  system  will  be  in  place  to  identify  early  the emergence of resistance in priority pathogens and to critical antimicrobials.Nationwide expansion will be planned at the end of this phase of NAP in 2022. The Plan will be rolled out as below:

Objective 2.1: Set up a national surveillance system for antimicrobial resistance under the leadership of a National Coordinating Centre.

## Strategic  Objective  3:  HYGIENE,  INFECTION  PREVENTION AND CONTROL (IPC)

Infection prevention and control, especially in the context of hospitals, is an important aspect  of  a  strategic  plan  to  contain  AMR  since  clinical  settings  represent  an ecosystem of  high  antimicrobial  usage.  Within  this  ecosystem,  exist  patients,  who may be immunologically impaired. These patients not only represent the population that  is  vulnerable  to  serious,  life-threatening  infections,  at  the  same  time,  they promote the emergence of resistance.

On the other hand, better hygiene (WaSH) and Infection prevention control represent methods to cut down on the spread of infections in ambulatory human and animal care  facilities, in food  production  systems  and  in  the  community  in  general. Vaccination in humans and animals and biosecurity in food production systems are specific  interventions  that  if  implemented  effectively,  can  result  in  better  health outcomes and reduced risk of emergence of AMR.

The  Situation  Analysis  of  measures  related  to  hygiene,  infection  prevention  and control in human, animal and related sectors in Myanmar reveals platforms that have been developed. However, in the absence of standardised guidelines, awareness, training and resources, the quality and scale of implementation has been less than optimal. Infection control and patient safety program in hospitals and biosecurity and good  animal  husbandry  practices  capacity  developed  in  partnership  with  FAO following  Highly  Pathogenic  Avian  Influenza(HPAI)  outbreaks  are  platforms  that could  be  capitalised.  Other  measures  such  as  AMR  stewardship  programme  in healthcare  settings  or  ambulatory  settings,  in  human  and  animal  health  and  food production sectors and HAI surveillance are yet to be initiated.

The Strategic Plan as outlined below aims to roll out a comprehensive multi-sectoral national  IPC  programme  on  a  limited  scale  in  healthcare  facilities  in  public  and private sector and in selected food chains (farms, slaughterhouses, food processors, aquaculture etc.). Similarly, HAI surveillance will be implemented in few public and private healthcare facilities. In community settings,  formal campaigns for sanitation and hygiene including biosecurity and animal husbandry practices and food handling practices on a small scale in animal and food production sites. Human and animal vaccination  are  well-developed  program  that  will  be  further  consolidated  and strengthened.

Objective  3.1:  To  establish  a  national  infection  prevention  and control  programme  through  full  implementation  and  compliance with the IPC guidelines within healthcare settings, animal husbandry systems, fisheries and the food chain

Strategic  intervention  3.1  Create  a  formal  organizational  structure  to ensure proper development and use of infection prevention and control policies  and  strategies  in  health  care  settings,  animal  rearing  facilities and in fisheries

## KEY ACTIVITIES

## Strategic  Objective  4:  OPTIMISE  USE  OF  ANTIMICROBIAL MEDICINES

Use of antimicrobials in any form, even when rational and prudent, can precipitate resistance in target microbes. High antibiotic use may reflect over-prescription, easy access  through  over-the-counter  sales,  and  more  recently  sales  via  the  Internet which are widespread in many countries.

The  situation analysis reveals that Myanmar  has  a  fully functional National Regulatory Authority that is responsible for regulation and licensing; pharmacovigilance and market authorization. Post licensing inspections including for retail  pharmacies and OTC sales are carried out on national scale but with limited effectiveness,  given  the  complex  challenges  of  mostly  import  based  system  of procurement  and  illegal  drug  movement.  The  country  lacks  important  instruments and  systems  such  as  a  National  AMR  containment  policy,  AMU  surveillance including sales of antimicrobial agents. Animal health sector lags on all of the above fronts and is also constrained by lack of regulatory powers.

Myanmarwill  establish  a  robust  system  for  regulation  and  surveillance  of  use  of antimicrobial  agents  for  control  of  use  of  antimicrobial  substances  in  human, veterinary and food production sectors. Some of the measures taken will include a National  AMR  Containment  and  Use  Policy  and  related  regulatory  frameworks, National  Drug  Policy,  National  Drug  Regulatory  Authority  for  Veterinary  Sector, essential medicines list and standard treatment guidelines with special reference to use  of  antimicrobial  agents,  evidence  based  guidelines  for  National  Antimicrobial Stewardship  Programme  an  AMU  monitoring  programme  in  human  and  animal health care, ambulatory  and  community  settings  and  food  animals  including, residues  testing  in  food  products.  All  of  the  above  systems  to  optimise  use  of antimicrobials,  however, will  be  implemented on  a limited  scale  during  2017-2022. Formal assessments will be carried out at the end of this period before nationwide scale up. The Strategic Plan to establish the above is as outlined below:

Objective 4.1: Establish a national AMR  containment  policy, Antimicrobial Stewardship Programmes  (AMSP)  and  Standard Treatment Guidelines (STG) at the national scale for prudent use of antimicrobials

Strategic intervention 4.1 Create a national AMR containment policy for control of use of antimicrobials in humans and animals, and establish a comprehensive evidence-based formal antimicrobial stewardship programmes at the national level

## KEY ACTIVITIES

The  TWG  (AMU)  in  collaboration  with  TWG  (Surveillance)  and  TWG  (IPC)  will commission a task force to develop a National AMR Containment and Use Policy and related regulatory frameworks. Within this policy framework, the task force will:

2017-19

- 1. Propose a formal organisational structure responsible for implementation  of  the  National  AMR  containment  policy.  The Policy  will  mandate  provisions  for  the  five  strategic  objectives enshrined in GAP and NAP AMR for Myanmar
- 2. Formulate regulatory framework for control of human  and veterinary  use  of  antimicrobial  substances,  including  but  not limited  to  the  phasing  out  of  Antimicrobial  Growth  Promoters (AGPs)  and  establishment  of  system  for  certification  of  farm products free from antibiotic residue
- 3. Under supervision of DG FDA and DG Medical Services, develop an  essential  medicines  list  with  special  reference  to  use  of antimicrobial  agents.  Antimicrobial  agents  in  the  EML  will  be considered for inclusion based on Myanmar's situation of current levels  of  AMR,  availability,  supply  chains,  financial  outlays  and international  guidelines  and  standard  treatment  guidelines  in human  medicine,  veterinary  medicine,  aquaculture  and  food production (including antimicrobial growth promoters; AGPs).
- 4. STGs (including antimicrobials) will be developed by the taskforce for training, supervision and supporting critical decisionmaking  in  antimicrobial  use  practices,  in  human  and  veterinary healthcare and food production section
- 5. Conduct  baseline  surveys  to  assess  the  extent,  barriers  and enablers of AMSP at institutional levels
- 6. Develop comprehensive, evidence based guidelines for a National Antimicrobial Stewardship Programme (AMSP) with aim of improving and measuring the appropriate use of antimicrobials in  human  and  animal  health  care,  ambulatory  and  community

## settings as well as aquaculture.

Under the overall supervision of TWG (AMU)

2018-22

- 7. DG  Medical Services (MoH) and DG  LVBD  (MoALI) will implement AMR policy for control of human and veterinary use of antimicrobial substances, including the phasing out of Antimicrobial Growth Promoters (AGPs). Limited scale implementation  of  the  national  AMSP  in  human  and  animal health care, ambulatory and community settings and food animals will be done. This will be accompanied by monitoring and concurrent  evaluation  followed  by  nationwide  implementation  in the next phase of NAP.

- 2. MoHS will further strengthen DG FDAin serving its mandates of drug  control,  import,  manufacture,  quality,  distribution,  pricing, market  authorization,  advertising,  retail  sales,  and  inspection, and to implement the relevant policies. DG FDA will cover drugs used in human health (and support regulation of  animal health, aquaculture and food production till the time the Veterinary FDA is fully functional).
- 3. MoALI  will establish a National Drug Regulatory Authority (NDRA) on the lines of and with mandates similar to DG FDA. The MoALI  FDA  will cover drugs used in animal health, aquaculture and food production.
- 4. The  NDRAs  will  develop  regulations  and  quality  checklists  for AMAs, APIs and OTC sales.
- 5. NDRAs will establish a system for the coordination and collation of data on drug quality (including supply, storage, transportation) from  different sources  or  parts  of the nation; tracking and reporting  suspected  product  quality  and  treatment  failure.  The system will be implemented by regional FDAs. Special attention will be given to international border areas known for illegal import of drugs
- 6. Within the regulatory frameworks laid down by NDRA, the MoHS, and MoALI will establish an institutional network with the capacity for quality control of antimicrobial agents or APIs. Existing system

of  inspection  by  national  and  regional  FDAs  of  MoHS  will  be reviewed  for  its  efficiency.  Regional  FDAs  will  be  strengthened and set up and will be responsible for carrying out inspections in different types of pharmaceutical establishments; formal registration procedures for drugs; and legal provisions for penal sanctions  for  non-compliance.  Relevant  authorities  within  the regional  FDAs  will  be  tasked  with  their  implementation  and enforcement  of  regulatory  provisions.  Human  resources  will  be adequately provisioned for effective monitoring and enforcement

- 7. Regional  FDAs  will  also  be  responsible  for  strengthening  the pharmaceutical supply chain, including the procurement, supply and management system in human health,  veterinary and food production sectors
- 8. TWG (AMU) in collaboration with CEU and veterinary counterpart will conduct independent periodic surveys to estimate the extent of  OTC and inappropriate sales of antibiotics and  APIs and the drivers  for  the  same  and  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  OTC regulations done and corrective measures undertaken

2022

## KEY ACTIVITIES

Under the overall technical guidance of TWG (AMU), TWG (Surveillance) and TWG (IPC)

2017

- 1. ASCU  will  establish  a  subcommittee  called  Antimicrobial  Use Surveillance Committee (AUSC) with appropriate mandate, TORs and Focal Point (FP) that links with ASCU

2018

- 2. The AUSC will coordinate policies on AMU and monitoring their impact on AMR. ASUC will design an AMU monitoring program in humans  and  food  animals  including,  residues  testing  in  food products (guidelines and standards for surveillance design, data type,  reporting  formats,  reporting  sites,  sources  of  antimicrobial usage/sales data, list of indicators). AUSC will monitor sales data in humans  as  well as animals (sales quantity per kg of slaughtered  animal,  sales  quantity  per  PCU  etc.).  In  addition, point prevalence surveys will be conducted in collaboration with CEU and Veterinary counterpart to assess quantity and quality of AMU  in  different settings. Longitudinal surveillance will be planned in the next phase of NAP.
- 3. In collaboration with Veterinary Assay Laboratory, AUSC will also develop  guidelines  to  implement  residue  testing  including  data sharing

2019-22

- 4. AUSC  will  implement  AMU  surveillance  and  residue  testing. Healthcare  facilities,  including in ambulatory  and  community settings (human and animal pharmacies etc.) and parts of animal husbandry chains (e.g. farm level) will be recruited on a limited scale.  For  residue  testing,  surveillance  sites  operationalised  for AMR Surveillance in 2.1 (7) will be recruited. AMU surveillance and residue testing will be conducted on limited scale by  2022.

## Illustrative Indicators

-  AMU surveillance and monitoring system
-  Sales data for AMAs at the national level
-  Actionable recommendations on modifying AMU to contain AMR

## Strategic Objective 5: (ECONOMIC) CASE FOR SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENTS AND INCREASE INVESTMENTS IN NEW MEDICINES, DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS, VACCINES AND OTHER INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE ANTIMICROBIAL USE

The GAP AMR posits that the economic case should reflect the need for capacity building  and  training  in  low  resource  settings,  while  developing  evidence  based interventions  to  reduce  infections  and  combat  AMR.  The  2001  strategy  for  AMR containment could not achieve its goals; one of the reasons cited for the same is that there  was  absence  of  economic  assessments,  which  evaluated  the  cost  of  doing nothing versus the cost/benefits of action at the present.

The Situational Analysis in Myanmar indicates that research on AMR has not been a priority  for  both  policy  makers  and  research  community.  Given  the  widespread irrational use of AMAs, AMR is expected to be sizable public health threat, as has been demonstrated in MDR-TB rates in the country. This calls for policy and program relevant research to support planning and implementation of public health interventions. The  phase  of development of the health system  provides an opportunity to put in place strategic research agenda for public health research and AMR in particular to inform health system responses.

The  Strategic  Plan  lays  down  a  roadmap  for  establishing  a  strategic  research agenda, with systematically prioritised research areas and knowledge gaps related to  AMR that  will  feed  into  a  national  policy  for  research  and  innovation.  By  2022, multi-stakeholder  platform  and  research  consortia  will  be  established  that  will generate program and policy relevant evidence on and compare cost effectiveness of  AMR  control  strategies.  The  strategic  plan  also  envisions  collaborations  with national and international agencies, for implementation of strategic research agenda. This will be one of the key strategies for Myanmar, given its existing nature of AMR threat and limited institutional capacity.

Objective 5.1: To promote sustainable investment in new medicines,  diagnostic  tools,  vaccines  and  other  interventions  by developing  a  strategic  research  agenda  and  national  research policy

Strategic intervention 5.1 Generate  cost  effectiveness and  benefit evidence  for  reducing  AMU  &amp;  AMR;  develop  a  national  strategic research agenda

## KEY ACTIVITIES

Under the overall supervision of TWG (Research):

2017-18

- 1. The  Department  of  Medical  Research  (DMR)  will  create  an inventory of relevant networks, initiatives, institutions and experts involved  in  AMR  research  across  human  and  animal  health sectors  in  Myanmar.  The  DMR  will  assess  existing  research, capacities,  future  plans  and  funding  sources  for  research  and innovations through a landscape analysis.
- 2. DMR will develop a Strategic research agenda, with systematically  prioritised  research  areas  and  knowledge  gaps related  to  research  and  innovation  in  the  field  of  AMR,  and resource needs that are relevant for Myanmar (in terms of human resources, materials and funding).  Priority research will include:
- a. Research to estimate and characterize burden and risk of AMR  and  AMU  in  human,  animal  and  food  production sectors including prescribing behaviours as well as treatment and care-seeking, barriers and drivers for uptake  of  prudent  antimicrobial  use  practices.  Special focus will be on broader socioeconomic burden of antimicrobial resistance and cost effectiveness and feasibility of interventions to reduce AMR and AMU across different sectors.
- b. Systems and policy research including operational research to understand and improve priority areas such as regulatory frameworks and their enforcement, stakeholder analysis,  human  resources,  supply  chains,  public  private partnerships, interoperability between different elements of AMR control plans and sectors, information management systems,  AMR  and  AMU  surveillance  and  use  in  health care  and  ambulatory  settings  across  sectors,  laboratory support
- 2017-18 3. TWG (Research) will develop a national policy for research and

2018-19

innovation, including research into alternatives for AMU practices, based on the research agenda drawn up by the DMR

- 4. TWG  (Research)  will  establish  a  multi-stakeholder  platform  to guide AMR research and innovation. The research platforms will develop  research  consortia,  and  establish  collaboration  with national and international agencies, for implementation of strategic research agenda
- 2020-22
- 5. TWG (Research) will make evidence available through research databases, peer reviewed publications, policy briefs, policy advocacy  dialogues  to  inform  national  and  local  policies  and strategic  interventions  in  different  strategic  objectives  to  reduce the need for antimicrobial in several settings (health care, animal husbandry, aquaculture and food production)

## Way Forward

The National Action Plan for prevention and control of AMR in  Myanmarhas been prepared  by  stakeholders  from  different  ministries  in  Myanmar.  The  Plan  is  a Strategic Plan with Operational details. The Plan takes cognizance of the limitations and capitalizes on the strengths and emerges as a comprehensive document that describes the country's vision of AMR prevention and control.

The Plan has built  upon  some of  the  critical  insights  that  have  emerged  from  the Situation  Analysis  and  a  host  of  interviews,  guided  discussions  and  participative dialogues that have been undertaken with multiple stakeholders. The NAP AMR of Myanmar in its current form provides a constructive opportunity for the government to  fine  tune  it  based  on  its  local  realities  and  sensitivities.  Most  importantly,  it presents an affirmative statement of goals, objectives and strategic interventions that will be deployed to achieve the objectives set out clearly in the document.

The strategic plan envisions collaborations with national and international agencies, for implementation of a strategic research agenda that will serve as a major strategy for  the  country,  given  its  urgent  evidence  needs  to  guide  program  planning  and action.  Essential  elements  of  AMR  containment  which  have  so  far  not  completely taken off the ground  will now  see  movement  as  comprehensive  awareness programmes  are  conducted,  surveillance  of  AMR  and  AMU  including  laboratory capacity,  IPC  and  AMSP  are  strengthened  and  other  public  health  functions  are aligned to the new AMR goals.

Following submission  of  the  final report to the World  Health  Assembly,  the Government  of  Myanmarwill  continue  with  its  deliberations  and  planning  process under  the  leadership  of  NMSC.  Next,  the  NMSC  through  its  constituent  NACC, TWGs and Task Forces will draw up a detailed operational plan  in  addition  to  its budget  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  plan  for  successful  implementation  of  the activities. Most of these activities will be implemented by the key actors as outlined in the strategic plan that covers the period 2017-22.

The  successful  implementation  of  the  NAP  AMR  will  bring  together  all  the  critical players  from  the  human  and  animal  health  and  related  domains  creating  greater responsibility, ownership and transparency. Working closely with a more sensitised and  aware  population,  the  country  will  bring  down  its  levels  of  AMR  and  going forward institutionalise mechanisms to arrest its spread.

## Annexure  1: Interpretation  of  phase  of  AMR  prevention  and control program implementation

Phase of Programme Implementation

## What it means

Phase 1

Phase of Exploration and Adoption

Phase 2 Phase of Programme Installation

There are no programmes implemented in a systematic manner in  order  to  conduct  AMR  prevention  and  control  in  the  country. However, the process of designing a program has been initiated, and  depending  on  the  progress  made  (as  seen  through  the indicators), it may be that one or more of the following activities are being undertaken:

- -Identification of needs, options and resources
- -Identification of potential barriers to implementation (funding, human resources, system responsiveness, etc.)
- -Investing in systems to augment their readiness to deploy the  programme  and  overcome  the  identified  barriers  in implementation
- -Identifying structures (both in policy making and implementation frameworks)  to  aid  in  the  implementation of the programne

As the nation gets closer to the end of Phase 1, it is on the verge of  implementing  (at  any  scale,  even  a  pilot  project)  an  AMR surveillance programme.

The decision toimplement a programme has been made and the initial set of activities have been undertaken in order to launch the program. These may include:

- -Capacity building
- -Resource allocation
- -Establishment of data transmission, security, and sharing protocols
- -Development  of  process  indicators,  standard  operation protocols and  other guidelines to be adhered  to by institutions participating in the programme

## Phase 3

## Phase of Initial Implementation

## Phase 4 Phase of Full Operation

## Phase 5

## Phase of Sustainable Operation

In  course  of  the  second  phase,  there  is  more  emphasis  on development  of  infrastructure,  and  allocation  of  resources  in order to implement a programme in a defined context and then scale it up to the national context in the subsequent phases.

This  is  probably  the  most  challenging  phase  in  the  stages  of early implementation of  any  programme  within  the  context  of developing  nations.  In  this  phase,  there  is  a  need  to  initiate  a change  or  an  intervention,  which  may  have  patchy  uptake  or maybe avoided altogether.

- -In course of this phase, a functional model of the program is identified
- -All protocols, SOPs, etc. undergo a real world challenge

This is a very crucial phase and most programs are likely to find it difficult to come out of this phase.

This  is  the  process  of scaling  up  a  successful  model of  the programme that may have been trialled in the previous phase.

- -The programme is part of accepted practice
- -There is  a  nation-wide  (or  a  large  scale)  adoption  of  the programme
- -The  programme  is  functional  by  generating  outputs  and outcomes on a regular basis (seek proof of evidence)

This  is  the  highest  grade  of operational  efficiency  of  the programme and  indicates  that  the  programme  can  have  longterm survival.

- -The programme is resilient to changes in funding volume, partner  agency  support,  etc.  external  factors  which  were essential  for  installation  and  initial  implementation  of  the programme.
- -Through a functional M&amp;amp;E mechanism, there is systematic improvement  of  capacity,  especially  in  human  resources and system capacity, to enable the programme to function without  extensive  need  to  invest  in  continued  capacity building
